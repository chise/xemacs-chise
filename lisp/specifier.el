  "Create and initialize a new specifier.

This is a front-end onto `make-specifier' that allows you to create a
specifier and add specs to it at the same time.  TYPE specifies the
specifier type.  SPEC-LIST supplies the specification(s) to be added
to the specifier. Normally, almost any reasonable abbreviation of the
full spec-list form is accepted, and is converted to the full form;
however, if optional argument DONT-CANONICALIZE is non-nil, this
conversion is not performed, and the SPEC-LIST must already be in full
form.  See `canonicalize-spec-list'."

(defun set-specifier (specifier value &optional locale tag-set how-to-add)
  "Add a specification or specifications to SPECIFIER.

This function adds a specification of VALUE in locale LOCALE.
LOCALE indicates where this specification is active, and should be
a buffer, a window, a frame, a device, or the symbol `global' to
indicate that it applies everywhere.  LOCALE usually defaults to
`global' if omitted.

VALUE is usually what is called an \"instantiator\" (which, roughly
speaking, corresponds to the \"value\" of the property governed by
SPECIFIER).  The valid instantiators for SPECIFIER depend on the
type of SPECIFIER (which you can determine using `specifier-type').
The specifier `scrollbar-width', for example, is of type `integer',
meaning its valid instantiators are integers.  The specifier
governing the background color of the `default' face (you can
retrieve this specifier using `(face-background 'default)') is
of type `color', meaning its valid instantiators are strings naming
colors and color-instance objects.  For some types of specifiers,
such as `image' and `toolbar', the instantiators can be very
complex.  Generally this is documented in the appropriate predicate
function -- `color-specifier-p', `image-specifier-p',
`toolbar-specifier-p', etc.

NOTE: It does *not* work to give a VALUE of nil as a way of
removing the specifications for a locale.  Use `remove-specifier'
instead. (And keep in mind that, if you omit the LOCALE argument
to `remove-specifier', it removes *all* specifications!  If you
want to remove just the `global' specification, make sure to
specify a LOCALE of `global'.)

VALUE can also be a list of instantiators.  This means basically,
\"try each one in turn until you get one that works\".  This allows
you to give funky instantiators that may only work in some cases,
and provide more normal backups for the other cases. (For example,
you might like the color \"darkseagreen2\", but some X servers
don't recognize this color, so you could provide a backup
\"forest green\".  Color TTY devices probably won't recognize this
either, so you could provide a second backup \"green\".  You'd
do this by specifying this list of instantiators:

'(\"darkseagreen2\" \"forest green\" \"green\")

VALUE can also be various more complicated forms; see below.

Optional argument TAG-SET is a tag or a list of tags, to be associated
with the VALUE.  Tags are symbols (usually naming device types, such
as `x' and `tty', or device classes, such as `color', `mono', and
`grayscale'); specifying a TAG-SET restricts the scope of VALUE to
devices that match all specified tags. (You can also create your
own tags using `define-specifier-tag', and use them to identify
specifications added by you, so you can remove them later.)

Optional argument HOW-TO-ADD should be either nil or one of the
symbols `prepend', `append', `remove-tag-set-prepend',
`remove-tag-set-append', `remove-locale', `remove-locale-type',
or `remove-all'.  This specifies what to do with existing
specifications in LOCALE (and possibly elsewhere in the specifier).
Most of the time, you do not need to worry about this argument;
the default behavior of `remove-tag-set-prepend' is usually fine.
See `copy-specifier' and `add-spec-to-specifier' for a full
description of what each of these means.

VALUE can actually be anything acceptable to `canonicalize-spec-list';
this includes, among other things:

-- a cons of a locale and an instantiator (or list of instantiators)
-- a cons of a tag or tag-set and an instantiator (or list of
   instantiators)
-- a cons of a locale and the previous type of item
-- a list of one or more of any of the previous types of items

However, in these cases, you cannot give a LOCALE or TAG-SET,
because they do not make sense. (You will probably get an error if
you try this.)

Finally, VALUE can itself be a specifier (of the same type as
SPECIFIER), if you want to copy specifications from one specifier
to another; this is equivalent to calling `copy-specifier', and
LOCALE, TAG-SET, and HOW-TO-ADD have the same semantics as with
that function.

Note that `set-specifier' is exactly complementary to `specifier-specs'
except in the case where SPECIFIER has no specs at all in it but nil
is a valid instantiator (in that case, `specifier-specs' will return
nil (meaning no specs) and `set-specifier' will interpret the `nil'
as meaning \"I'm adding a global instantiator and its value is `nil'\"),
or in strange cases where there is an ambiguity between a spec-list
and an inst-list, etc. (The built-in specifier types are designed
in such a way as to avoid any such ambiguities.)

NOTE: If you want to work with spec-lists, you should probably not
use either `set-specifier' or `specifier-specs', but should use the
lower-level functions `add-spec-list-to-specifier' and `specifier-spec-list'.
These functions always work with fully-qualified spec-lists; thus, there
is no possibility for ambiguity and no need to go through the function
`canonicalize-spec-list', which is potentially time-consuming."

\(let-specifier SPECIFIER-LIST BODY...)

Each element of SPECIFIER-LIST should look like this:
\(SPECIFIER VALUE &optional LOCALE TAG-SET HOW-TO-ADD).

SPECIFIER is the specifier to be temporarily modified.  VALUE is the
instantiator to be temporarily added to SPECIFIER in LOCALE.  LOCALE,
TAG-SET and HOW-TO-ADD have the same meaning as in
`add-spec-to-specifier'.

The code resulting from macro expansion will add specifications to
specifiers using `add-spec-to-specifier'.  After BODY is finished, the
temporary specifications are removed and old spec-lists are restored.

LOCALE, TAG-SET and HOW-TO-ADD may be omitted, and default to nil.
The value of the last form in BODY is returned.

NOTE: If you want the specifier's instance to change in all
circumstances, use (selected-window) as the LOCALE.  If LOCALE is nil
or omitted, it defaults to `global'.
