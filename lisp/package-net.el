;;; Commentary:

;; Manipulate packages for the netinstall setup utility

;; The process should be so:

;; 1. The package maintainer or release manager makes a release
;; announcement.
;;
;; 2. For a new package releases the netinstall maintainer simply
;; needs to update `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/setup.ini'. This is
;; harder than it sounds because the file also includes information
;; about the binary releases. At the moment going to the netinstall
;; directory and typing:
;;
;;   `make XEMACS=<current executable location> setup.ini' 
;;
;; will do the right thing provided that:
;; 
;; (a) `package-net-cygwin32-binary-size' and
;; `package-net-win32-binary-size' are set correctly.
;;
;; (b) The binary pointed to by `XEMACS' has a current
;; `package-index.LATEST.pgp' file. If you don't specify the XEMACS=
;; part then you will get whatever is current for your build tree -
;; which is probably not what you want.
;;
;; You can run `package-net-convert-index-to-ini' manually and specify
;; REMOTE but I generally found that to be inconvenient and error-prone.
;;
;; 3. For package releases that's all you need to do. For binary
;; releases you need to build both cygwin and win32 binaries and put
;; them in appropriate tarballs:
;;
;; For cygwin, configure, make and install and then do (this is for
;; 21.1.13):
;;
;;   cd <install dir>
;;   tar cvzf xemacs-i686-pc-cygwin32-21.1.13.tar.gz \
;;      ./bin/i686-pc-cygwin32 ./lib/xemacs-21.1.13 \
;;      ./lib/xemacs/lock ./man/man1/xemacs.1 \
;;      ./man/man1/ctags.1 ./man/man1/gnu*.1'
;;
;;  Note that the naming of the package is important. Don't be tempted
;;  to change the order in any way.
;;
;; For win32 build and install the release and then (again for
;; 21.1.13):
;;
;;   cd <install dir>
;;   tar cvzf xemacs-i386-pc-win32-21.1.13.tar.gz ./XEmacs-21.1.13
;; 
;; The binaries should be uploaded to
;; `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/binaries/cygwin32' and
;; `ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/binaries/win32' respectively. Take
;; a note of their sizes and set `package-net-cygwin32-binary-size'
;; and `package-net-win32-binary-size' appropriately in this file and
;; then follow step 2.

;; What path should we use from the myriad available?
;; For netinstall we just want something simple, and anyway this is only to 
;; bootstrap the process. This will be:
;; <root>/setup/ for native windows
;; <root>/lib/xemacs/setup for cygwin.
;;
;;; To Do:
;;
;; 1. Package update functions should also update the installed
;; database so that running setup.exe again does not reinstall
;; packages.
;;
;; 2. Generating setup.ini should be more automatic.
