CHANGES-release

This file briefly describes all changes to XEmacs in the OXYMORON
series of releases.  In principle there should be no user interface
changes listed here, since this is intended to be a stable series.  In
practice, some bugfixes do involve user-visible changes.  In general
users should be happy about them, but they may affect workarounds you
have put in place.  So those that do are noted here with (**).

Also, the MS Windows platform support is not fully mature, and the GTK
platform support is explicitly experimental.  In those cases
improvements that provably do not affect other platforms are accepted.
The platform affected is noted, and the change is flagged (**).

Fixing a critical bug is not considered a "user interface change" in the
sense that there should be no way for it to interfere with you getting
more work done.

Where there are many changes, they will be grouped into run-time,
build-time, and "documentation and data" changes.

For more details, including developers involved and dates, see the
ChangeLogs, or use CVS diff to view the patches.

to XEmacs 21.4.4 "Artificial Intelligence"

  - (**) There is a bug in "window procedures" under MS Windows only.
    Non-debug builds print a warning on stderr, and you may want to
    consider XEmacs unstable (save and restart) if you see it (debug
    builds assert here).
  - Printing the selection is implemented for MS Windows
  - C-g now works on MS Windows
  - Kinsoku (text wrapping for Asian scripts) fixes
  - "Scrolling with no scrollbar" crash on MS Windows fixed
    Krause).
  - Case conversion works for Cyrillic
  - Help is available with C-x s
  - M-x locate-library completes library names
  - (**) `replace-match' supports FSF-style match subexpressions
  - `compose-mail' is supported in about.el
  - (**) Renaming custom.el to inhibit loading it works
  - (**) "Reset to standard" works with "set" and "saved" Custom
    buffers
  - `Unbalanced parentheses' bug when dealing with mixed comment
    styles in c++/java/etc. mode fixed
  - Byte-compiler optimization fixes
  - Dired can handle directory names with unusual characters
  - Popup menus work with popup-menu-titles turned off
  - (**) M-? now invokes Help
  - Data corruption in network streams on MS Windows fixed
  - A few improvements and bug fixes in GTK support.

  - (**) EsounD support is no longer autodetected; you must explicitly
    request it.  EsounD does evil things with signals and XEmacs
    cannot protect itself from the race conditions created.
  - (**) The "excessively long startup when not networked" (often on
    Red Hat Linux) problem is addressed with a configure option that
    defeats IPv6 host name canonicalization, `--with-ipv6-cname=no'.
    See also the discussion in PROBLEMS.
  - Better detection of Cygwin Perl
  - Support for old Cygwin betas dropped
  - Better support for Windows Millenium Edition

    etc/sample.init.el, German tutorial, CCL fonts documentation
