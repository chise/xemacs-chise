This directory contains the source for the setup program for the cygwin
net releases.



To-Do list:

ini.cc: add field in setup.ini to specify whether package is installed
by default, or not.

install.cc: scan newly installed files for README files, show list to
user, let them read them if they want.

download.cc: add a "total progress" indicator, like the install one.

add a "category" field to setup.ini, let user choose which categories
of packages to install, perhaps with a "custom..." button to lead to
the current chooser.

remember which packages were selected to be skipped, and which prev/curr/exp
option was last selected, and recall them each time the chooser runs.

Add friendly error reporting to simpsock.cc

Add option to download sources also.
