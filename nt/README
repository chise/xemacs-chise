The port was made much easier by the groundbreaking work of Geoff Voelker
and others who worked on the GNU Emacs port to NT. Their version is available
from http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html


* Required tools and sources
============================

1.  You will need Visual C++ V4.0 or later to compile everything. Personally
    we have tested V4.0, V4.2, V5.0 and v6.0.

    Note that Visual C++ assumes that the environment variables INCLUDE and
    LIB are set to specify the location of the includes and libraries.
    Your PATH environment variable also needs to include the DevStudio
    vc\bin and sharedide\bin directories.

    Visual C++ V5.0 installs a batch file called vcvars32.bat in
    c:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\bin\ (or wherever you installed it) that you
    can run before building to set up all of these environment variables.

2.  Grab the latest XEmacs source from ftp.xemacs.org if necessary.

    You'll also need the xemacs-base package from the binary-packages
    subdirectory and you'll probably also want at least the edit-utils,
    text-modes, fsf-compat, cc-mode, prog-modes and xemacs-devel
    packages.

    You'll also need the texinfo package unless you have a copy of
    makeinfo.exe on your machine.

    Unpack the packages into, say, "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\xemacs-packages".

3.  At this point you can choose to build for X and/or for Win32 native GUI.
    If you only want to build for the Win32 native GUI then skip the next
    section.


** Extra tools and sources required for X

If you want support for X you will also need:

1.  An X server. MI/X is available on the Internet for free; It is 
    available from: http://www.microimages.com/www/html/freestuf/mixdlfrm.htm

2.  Source for the MIT X11R6.3 libraries, available from: ftp.x.org

3.  You'll need to compile the MIT libraries without multi-thread support.
    To do this, there is an example Win32.cf and site.def provided which set
    the relevant flags. You will also need to apply the patch in nt/X11.patch
    in the xc/lib/X11 directory which will fix the DLL definition file.

    Once compiled and installed, you will need to apply the patch in
    nt/Xmd.patch. This is messy and better solutions would be appreciated.

4.  Goto step 2 under 'Optional libraries' below.


* Optional libraries
====================

1.  If you want XPM image and toolbar support grab the latest version of the
    xpm sources (xpm-3.4k.tar.gz at time of writing) and unpack them somewhere.
    Copy nt\xpm.mak from the xemacs sources to the lib subdirectory of the
    xpm sources, cd to that directory and build xpm with 'nmake -f xpm.mak'.

2.  You probably also want PNG image support. Grab the latest versions of zlib
    and libpng (zlib-1.1.3 and libpng-1.0.2 at time of writing), unpack them
    somewhere and read the respective READMEs for details on how to build them.
    The following build procedure works for zlib-1.1.3 and libpng-1.0.2:

    cd to the zlib directory, type 'copy msdos\makefile.w32 Makefile' and
    then type 'nmake'.

    cd to the libpng directory, rename or move the zlib directory to ..\zlib
    and type 'nmake -f scripts\makefile.w32'.

3.  If you want TIFF support, grap the latest version of libtiff (tiff-v3.4
    at time of writing) and unpack it somewhere. Copy nt\tiff.mak from the 
    xemacs sources to the contrib\winnt subdirectory of the tiff sources, 
    cd to that directory and build libtiff with 'nmake -f tiff.mak'. Note:
    tiff.mak has only been verified to work under WinNT, not Win95 or 98. 
    However, the lastest distribution of libtiff includes a 
    contrib\win95\makefile.w95; that might work.

4.  If you want JPEG support grab the latest version of jpegsrc (jpeg-6b at 
    time of writing) and read the README for details on how to build it.

5.  If you want X-Face support, grab compface distribution and unpack it 
    somewhere.  Copy nt\compface.mak from xemacs sources to the compface
    directory.  cd to that directory and build libcompface with 
    'nmake -f compface.mak'.


* Building
==========

1.  cd to the nt subdirectory of the xemacs distribution and build xemacs:
    `nmake install -f xemacs.mak`, but read on before hitting Enter.

2.  If you're building with XPM support, add this to the nmake command line:
	HAVE_XPM=1 XPM_DIR="x:\location\of\your\xpm\sources"
    and similarly for JPEG and TIFF support.

    If you're building with PNG support, add this to the nmake command line:
	HAVE_PNG=1 PNG_DIR="x:\location\of\your\png\sources"
	ZLIB_DIR="x:\location\of\your\zlib\sources"

    If you want to build with GIF support, add this to the nmake command line:
	HAVE_GIF=1

    If you're building with X-Face support, add this to the nmake command line:
        HAVE_XFACE=1 COMPFACE_DIR="x:\location\of\your\compface\sources"

    If you're building for X, add this to the nmake command line:
	HAVE_X=1 X11_DIR=x:\root\directory\of\your\X11\installation

3.  By default, XEmacs will expect to find its packages in the subdirectories
    "site-packages", "mule-packages" and "xemacs-packages" under the package
    prefix directory "c:\Program Files\XEmacs". If you want it to look for
    these subdirectories elsewhere, add this to the nmake command line:
	PACKAGE_PREFIX="x:\your\package\directory"
    If you change your mind and want to alter the package prefix directory
    after you've built XEmacs, delete the file nt\obj\emacs.obj and rebuild
    with the new PACKAGE_PREFIX setting.

4.  By default, XEmacs will be installed in directories under the directory
    "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.2". If you want to install it
    elsewhere, add this to the nmake command line:
	INSTALL_DIR="x:\your\installation\directory"

5.  XEmacs can build its info files more quickly if you have a copy of the
    makeinfo program. If you have a copy, add this to the nmake command line:
	MAKEINFO="x:\location\of\makeinfo.exe"
    If you don't have a copy of makeinfo then you'll need to have installed
    the XEmacs texinfo package.

6.  Now you can press Enter. nmake will build temacs, the DOC file, update
    the elc's, dump xemacs and install the relevant files in the directories
    under the installation directory.

    Unless you set INSTALL_DIR above, the file that you should run to start
    XEmacs will be installed as
        "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.2\i586-pc-win32\runxemacs.exe".
    You may want to create a shortcut to that file from your Desktop or
    Start Menu.


* Debugging under MS Developer Studio
=====================================

The build process always creates debugging and "Source Browser" information
in the source tree for use with DevStudio. If you actually want to debug
XEmacs you should probably build a debug version of XEmacs:

1.  Delete the directory nt\obj and it's contents.

2.  Add DEBUG_XEMACS=1 to the nmake command line and rebuild. You probably
    don't want to install your debug build so you should tell nmake to build
    the 'all' target instead of the 'install' target.

3.  To make use of the debugging and "Source Browser" information, create a
    new "console" project in DevStudio and, under Project/Settings, set:
	Debug: executable name = full path of src\xemacs.exe
	Link: output file name = full path of src\temacs.exe
	Browse Info: browse info file name = full path of src\temacs.bsc
    Remember to close the Source Browser file in DevStudio before rebuilding.

4.  Start XEmacs from within DevStudio or by running src\xemacs.exe so that
    you get a console window which may contain helpful debugging info.

5.  To display the contents of a lisp variable click Debug/QuickWatch, type
    debug_print(variable) and click Recalculate. The output will appear in
    the console window.

6.  To view lisp variables in the "Watch" window wrap the variable in one of
    the helper functions from the file src\console-msw.c. eg type
    DSTRING(variable) in the "Watch" window to inspect a lisp string.
