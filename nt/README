	     Building and Installing XEmacs on Windows NT

The port was made much easier by the groundbreaking work of Geoff Voelker
and others who worked on the GNU Emacs port to NT. Their version is available
from http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html

To get it working you will need:

1.  You will need Visual C++ V4.2 or later to compile everything. Personally we
    have tested V4.2 and V5.0.
    Note that Visual C++ assumes a couple of environment variables INCLUDE and
    LIB to be set which specify the location of the includes and libraries.
    At this point you can select X or Win32 native support.

2.  Grab the latest XEmacs source from ftp.xemacs.org if necessary. All Win32
    support is in the nt\ subdirectory. You'll also need the xemacs-base
    package from the binary-packages subdirectory and you'll probably also
    want at least the edit-utils, text-utils, cc-mode and prog-utils packages.
    Unpack the packages into, say, "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\packages".


If you want to build for native GUI:

1.  If you want XPM and toolbar support grab the latest version of the xpm
    sources (xpm-3.4k.tar.gz at time of writing) and unpack them somewhere.
    Copy nt\xpm.mak from the xemacs sources to the lib subdirectory of the
    xpm sources, cd to that directory and build xpm with `nmake -f xpm.mak`.

2.  cd to the nt subdirectory of the xemacs distribution and build xemacs:
    `nmake install -f xemacs.mak`, but read on before hitting Enter.

3.  If you're building with XPM support, add this to the nmake command line:
	HAVE_XPM=1 XPM_DIR="x:\location\of\your\xpm\source\tree"

4.  By default, XEmacs will look for packages in
    "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\packages". If you want it to look elsewhere,
    add this to the nmake command line:
	PACKAGEPATH="x:\\location\\of\\your\\packages"
    Note the doubled-up backslashes in that path. If you want to change the
    package path after you've already built XEmacs, delete the file
    .\obj\emacs.obj and rebuild with the new value of PACKAGEPATH.

5.  By default, XEmacs will be installed in directories under the directory
    "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.0". If you want to install it
    elsewhere, add this to the nmake command line:
	INSTALL_DIR="x:\your\installation\directory"

6.  Now you can press Enter. nmake will build temacs, the DOC file, update the
    elc's, dump xemacs and install the relevant files in the directories under
    the installation directory. Unless you set INSTALL_DIR in step 5 above, the
    file that you should run to start XEmacs will be installed as
    "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.0\i386-pc-win32\runemacs.exe". You may
    want to create a shortcut to that file from your Desktop or Start Menu.

7.  The build process always creates debugging and "Source Browser" information
    in the source tree for use with MS DevStudio. If you actually want to debug
    XEmacs you should run XEmacs from the source directory instead of from the
    installation directory. You should probably also build a debug version of
    XEmacs; to do this start with a clean source tree and add DEBUG_XEMACS=1 to
    the nmake command line. You probably don't want to install your debug build
    so you should tell nmake to build the 'all' target instead of the 'install'
    target.

    To make use of the debugging and "Source Browser" information, create a new
    "console" project in MS DevStudio and, under Project/Settings, set:
	Debug: executable name = full path of src\xemacs.exe
	Link: output file name = full path of src\temacs.exe
	Browse Info: browse info file name = full path of src\temacs.bsc
    Remember to close the Source Browser file in DevStudio before rebuilding.


If you want support for X you will need:

1.  An X server. MI/X is available on the Internet for free; It is 
    available from:  http://www.microimages.com/www/html/freestuf/mixdlfrm.htm

2.  The MIT X11R6.3 libraries available from: ftp.x.org

3.  You'll need to compile the MIT libraries without multi-thread support.
    To do this, there is an example Win32.cf and site.def provided which
    set the relevant flags. You will also need to apply the patch in 
    nt/X11.patch in the xc/lib/X11 directory which will fix the DLL definition
    file. Once compiled and installed, you will need to apply the following
    patch to Xmd.h. This is messy and better solutions would be appreciated. 

4.  Goto 2 under 'native GUI' above and add this to the nmake command line:
	HAVE_X=1 X11_DIR=x:\root\directory\of\your\X11\installation
