This is a port of XEmacs to Windows 95/98/NT.  If you are looking for a port
of GNU Emacs, see http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html.


* Required tools and sources
============================

1.  You will need Visual C++ V4.0 or later to compile everything. Personally
    we have tested V4.0, V4.2, V5.0 and v6.0.

    Note that Visual C++ assumes that the environment variables INCLUDE and
    LIB are set to specify the location of the includes and libraries.
    Your PATH environment variable also needs to include the DevStudio
    vc\bin and sharedide\bin directories.

    Visual C++ V5.0 installs a batch file called vcvars32.bat in
    c:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\bin\ (or wherever you installed it) that you
    can run before building to set up all of these environment variables.

2.  Grab the latest XEmacs source from

      ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/

    or one of its mirrors listed at http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html .

    You'll also need the packages.  You probably want to get the unified
    packages bundle from

      ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/xemacs-sumo.tar.gz

    Although we don't recommend it, you can also retrieve just the packages
    you really need if you have an extremely slow net connection or are very
    short on disk space.  You can find the various packages in
    ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/.  You will need the
    xemacs-base package.  You'll also need the texinfo package unless you
    have a copy of makeinfo.exe on your machine.  If you want to download
    additional or updated packages from within XEmacs you'll need the efs,
    dired and vm packages.  You'll probably also want at least the
    edit-utils, text-modes, fsf-compat, cc-mode, prog-modes and xemacs-devel
    packages.

    Unpack the packages into "x:\your\choice\XEmacs\xemacs-packages",
    for example "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\xemacs-packages".

3.  At this point you can choose to build for X and/or for Win32 native GUI.
    If you only want to build for the Win32 native GUI then skip the next
    section.


** Extra tools and sources required for X

If you want support for X you will also need:

1.  An X server. MI/X is available on the Internet as trialware; it is 
    available from: http://www.microimages.com/www/html/mix/

2.  Source for the MIT X11R6.3 libraries, available from: ftp.x.org

3.  You'll need to compile the MIT libraries without multi-thread support.
    To do this, there is an example Win32.cf and site.def provided which set
    the relevant flags. You will also need to apply the patch in nt/X11.patch
    in the xc/lib/X11 directory which will fix the DLL definition file.

    Once compiled and installed, you will need to apply the patch in
    nt/Xmd.patch. This is messy and better solutions would be appreciated.

4.  Goto step 2 under 'Optional libraries' below.


* Optional libraries
====================

1.  You really want the XPM library.  Grab the latest version of the
    xpm sources (xpm-3.4k.tar.gz at time of writing) from
    ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/ and unpack them somewhere.
    Copy nt\xpm.mak from the xemacs sources to the lib subdirectory of the
    xpm sources, cd to that directory and build xpm with 'nmake -f xpm.mak'.

2.  You probably also want PNG image support. Grab the latest versions of zlib
    and libpng (zlib-1.1.3 and libpng-1.0.2 at time of writing) from
    ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/, unpack them somewhere and read
    the respective READMEs for details on how to build them.  The following
    build procedure works for zlib-1.1.3 and libpng-1.0.2:

    cd to the zlib directory, type 'copy msdos\makefile.w32 Makefile' and
    then type 'nmake'.

    cd to the libpng directory, rename or move the zlib directory to ..\zlib
    and type 'nmake -f scripts\makefile.w32'.

3.  If you want TIFF support, grap the latest version of libtiff (tiff-v3.4
    at time of writing) from ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/ and unpack
    it somewhere. Copy nt\tiff.mak from the xemacs sources to the
    contrib\winnt subdirectory of the tiff sources, cd to that directory and
    build libtiff with 'nmake -f tiff.mak'. Note: tiff.mak has only been
    verified to work under WinNT, not Win95 or 98.  However, the lastest
    distribution of libtiff includes a contrib\win95\makefile.w95; that might
    work.

4.  If you want JPEG support grab the latest version of jpegsrc (jpeg-6b at 
    time of writing) from ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/ and read the
    README for details on how to build it.

5.  If you want X-Face support, grab the compface distribution from
    ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/aux/ and unpack it somewhere.
    Copy nt\compface.mak from xemacs sources to the compface directory.
    cd to that directory and build libcompface with 'nmake -f compface.mak'.


* Building
==========

1.  cd to the nt subdirectory of the xemacs distribution and copy the file
    config.inc.samp to config.inc.  Make any necessary modifications.  This
    file controls the options that XEmacs is built with:

    -- If you're building with XPM support, modify the appropriate lines in
       config.inc as follows:

       HAVE_XPM=1
       XPM_DIR="x:\location\of\your\xpm\sources"
    
       and similarly for JPEG and TIFF support.

    -- If you're building with PNG support, modify the appropriate lines in
       config.inc as follows:

       HAVE_PNG=1
       PNG_DIR="x:\location\of\your\png\sources"
       ZLIB_DIR="x:\location\of\your\zlib\sources"

    -- If you're building with GIF support, modify the appropriate lines in
       config.inc as follows:

       HAVE_GIF=1

    -- If you're building with X-Face support, modify the appropriate lines in
       config.inc as follows:

       HAVE_XFACE=1
       COMPFACE_DIR="x:\location\of\your\compface\sources"

    -- If you're building for X, modify the appropriate lines in config.inc
       as follows:

       HAVE_X_WINDOWS=1
       X11_DIR=x:\root\directory\of\your\X11\installation

    -- By default, XEmacs will expect to find its packages in the
       subdirectories "site-packages", "mule-packages" and "xemacs-packages"
       under the directory "c:\Program Files\XEmacs". If you want it to look
       for these subdirectories elsewhere, modify the appropriate lines in
       config.inc as follows:

       PACKAGE_PREFIX="x:\your\package\directory"

       Make sure that the directory pointed to by PACKAGE_PREFIX contains
       the xemacs-packages directory into which you installed the packages.

    -- XEmacs can build its info files more quickly if you have a copy of the
       makeinfo program. If you have a copy, modify the appropriate lines in
       config.inc as follows:

       MAKEINFO="x:\location\of\makeinfo.exe"

       If you don't have a copy of makeinfo then you'll need to have installed
       the XEmacs texinfo package.

2.  If you want to install XEmacs when you build it, modify the appropriate
    lines in config.inc as follows (you can also run XEmacs from its build
    directory):

       INSTALL_DIR="x:\your\installation\directory"

    (By default, XEmacs will be installed in directories under the directory
    "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.2".)

2.  If you want to build xemacs on the command line, use
    `nmake install -f xemacs.mak', or just `nmake -f xemacs.mak' if you want
    to run XEmacs from its build directory.  nmake will build temacs, the DOC
    file, update the elc's, dump xemacs and (optionally) install the relevant
    files in the directories under the installation directory.

    If you chose to install XEmacs, the file that you should run to start
    XEmacs will be installed (by default) as
        "c:\Program Files\XEmacs\XEmacs-21.2\i586-pc-win32\xemacs.exe".

    To run from the build directory, run the file "nt\xemacs.exe" off of the
    root of the build directory.

    You may want to create a shortcut to the file from your Desktop or
    Start Menu.

3.  To build using MS Developer Studio, you can use the workspace file
    `nt/xemacs.dsw'.  This was prepared for Visual C++ 5.0; if you have
    a different version and this file doesn't work, just open up
    `nt/xemacs.mak' from within MS Developer Studio and it will offer to
    wrap this Makefile in a workspace file, from which you can build.
    Assuming you want to run from the build directory (which you will
    want to do if you are planning on doing any development work on XEmacs),
    use the following settings in Project/Settings...:

    Under the General tab:

    Build command line: NMAKE /f xemacs.mak
    Output file name: ..\src\xemacs.exe
    Browse info file name: ..\src\temacs.bsc

    Under the Debug tab:

    Executable for debug session: ..\src\xemacs.exe


    If you want to install XEmacs when it's built, change the build command
    line to "NMAKE install /f xemacs.mak". (You will have to make the same
    change even if you use the provided workspace nt/xemacs.dsw.)


* Debugging under MS Developer Studio
=====================================

The build process always creates debugging and "Source Browser" information
in the source tree for use with DevStudio. However that information is not
very useful unless you build a debug version of XEmacs:

1.  Set DEBUG_XEMACS=1 and DEPEND=1 in config.inc and rebuild.

2.  See instructions above for obtaining a workspace file for use with
    MS Developer Studio.  Build and debug your XEmacs this way.

3.  To display the contents of a lisp variable, type Shift-F9 (or use the
    menu) to bring up the QuickWatch window, type debug_print(variable) and
    click Recalculate. The output will appear in a console window, as well
    as in the Debug window in MS Developer Studio.

4.  To view Lisp variables in the "Watch" window wrap the variable in one of
    the helper functions from the file src\console-msw.c, for example type
    DSTRING(variable) in the "Watch" window to inspect a Lisp string.
