*******************************

Learning XEmacs is a lifelong activity.  Even people who have used Emacs
for years keep discovering new features.  Therefore this document cannot
be complete.  Instead it is aimed at the person who is either
considering XEmacs for their own use, or has just obtained it and is
wondering what to do next.  It is also useful as a reference to
available resources.

   The previous maintainer of the FAQ was Anthony Rossini
<rossini@biostat.washington.edu>, who started it, after getting tired
of hearing JWZ complain about repeatedly having to answer questions.
Ben Wing <ben@xemacs.org> and Chuck Thompson <cthomp@xemacs.org>, the
principal authors of XEmacs, then took over and Ben did a massive
update reorganizing the whole thing.  At which point Anthony took back
over, but then had to give it up again.  Some of the other contributors
to this FAQ are listed later in this document.

   The previous version was converted to hypertext format, and edited by
Steven L. Baur <steve@xemacs.org>.  It was converted back to texinfo by
Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org>.  The FAQ was then maintained by
Andreas Kaempf <andreas@sccon.com>, who passed it on to ChristianNyb/o.

   If you notice any errors or items which should be added or amended to
this FAQ please send email to Sandra Wambold <faq@xemacs.org>.  Include
`XEmacs FAQ' on the Subject: line.

1.0: Introduction
=================

Q1.0.1: What is XEmacs?
-----------------------

XEmacs is a powerful, highly customizable open source text editor and
application development system, with full GUI support.  It is protected
under the GNU Public License and related to other versions of Emacs, in
particular GNU Emacs.  Its emphasis is on modern graphical user
interface support and an open software development model, similar to
Linux.  XEmacs has an active development community numbering in the
hundreds (and thousands of active beta testers on top of this), and runs
on all versions of MS Windows, on Linux, and on nearly every other
version of Unix in existence.  Support for XEmacs has been supplied by
Sun Microsystems, University of Illinois, Lucid, ETL/Electrotechnical
Laboratory, Amdahl Corporation, BeOpen, and others, as well as the
unpaid time of a great number of individual developers.

Q1.0.2: What is the current version of XEmacs?
----------------------------------------------

XEmacs versions 21.1.* are releases made from the current stable
sources.  XEmacs versions 21.2.* are releases made from the development
sources.  Check at `http://www.xemacs.org' for the current minor
version.

   XEmacs 19.16 was the last release of v19, released in November, 1997,
which was also the last version without international language support.

Q1.0.4: Why Another Version of Emacs?
-------------------------------------

For a detailed description of the differences between GNU Emacs and
XEmacs and a detailed history of XEmacs, check out the
     NEWS file (http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html)

   However, here is a list of some of the reasons why we think you might
consider using it:

   * It looks nicer.

   * The XEmacs maintainers are generally more receptive to suggestions
     than the GNU Emacs maintainers.

   * Many more bundled packages than GNU Emacs.

   * Binaries are available for many common operating systems.

   * Face support on TTY's.

   * A built-in toolbar.

   * Better Motif compliance.

   * Some internationalization support (including full MULE support, if
     compiled with it).

   * Variable-width fonts.

   * Variable-height lines.

   * Marginal annotations.

   * ToolTalk support.

   * XEmacs can be used as an Xt widget, and can be embedded within
     another application.

   * Horizontal and vertical scrollbars (using real toolkit scrollbars).

   * Better APIs (and performance) for attaching fonts, colors, and
     other properties to text.

   * The ability to embed arbitrary graphics in a buffer.

   * Completely compatible (at the C level) with the Xt-based toolkits.

Q1.0.5: Why Haven't XEmacs and GNU Emacs Merged?
------------------------------------------------

There are currently irreconcilable differences in the views about
technical, programming, design and organizational matters between RMS
and the XEmacs development team which provide little hope for a merge to
take place in the short-term future.

   If you have a comment to add regarding the merge, it is a good idea
to avoid posting to the newsgroups,  because of the very heated
flamewars that often result.  Mail your questions to
<xemacs-beta@xemacs.org> and <bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu>.

----------------------------------------------------

Yes.

   XEmacs 21.5 (perhaps 21.4 also?) works on MacOS X, although it
certainly will not feel very much like a Mac application as it has no
Mac-specific code in it.

   There is also a port of XEmacs 19.14 that works on all recent
versions of MacOS, from 8.1 through MacOS X, by Pitts Jarvis
<pjarvis@ispchannel.com>.  It runs in an equivalent of TTY mode only
(one single Macintosh window, 25 colors), but has a large number of
Mac-specific additions.  It's available at

1.3: Internationalization
=========================

Q1.3.1: What is the status of internationalization support aka MULE (including Asian language support?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both the stable and development versions of XEmacs include
internationalization support (aka MULE).  MULE currently (21.4) works on
UNIX and Linux systems.  It is possible to build with MULE on Windows
systems, but if you really need MULE on Windows, it is recommended that
you build and use the development (21.5) version, and deal with the
instability of the development tree.  Binaries compiled without MULE
support run faster than MULE capable XEmacsen.

Q1.3.2: How can I help with internationalization?
-------------------------------------------------

If you would like to help, you may want to join the
<xemacs-mule@xemacs.org> mailing list.  Especially needed are people
who speak/write languages other than English, who are willing to use
XEmacs/MULE regularly, and have some experience with Elisp.

   Translations of the TUTORIAL and man page are welcome, and XEmacs
does support multilingual menus, but we have few current translations.

Q1.3.3: How do I type non-ASCII characters?
-------------------------------------------

See question 3.5.7 (*note Q3.5.7::) in part 3 of this FAQ for some
simple methods that also work in non-MULE builds of XEmacs (but only for
one-octet coded character sets, and mostly for ISO 8859/1).  Many of the
methods available for Cyrillic (*note Q1.3.7::) work without MULE.
MULE has more general capabilities.  *Note Q1.3.5::.

   *Note Q3.2.7::, which covers display of non-ASCII characters.

Q1.3.4: Can XEmacs messages come out in a different language?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The message-catalog support was written but is badly bit-rotted.  XEmacs
20 and 21 did _not_ support it, and early releases of XEmacs 22 will
not either.

   However, menubar localization _does_ work.  To enable it, add to
your `Emacs' file entries like this:

     Emacs*XlwMenu.resourceLabels:                   True
     Emacs*XlwMenu.file.labelString:                 Fichier
     Emacs*XlwMenu.openInOtherWindow.labelString: 	In anderem Fenster oeffnen

   The name of the resource is derived from the non-localized entry by
removing punctuation and capitalizing as above.

Q1.3.5: Please explain the various input methods in MULE/XEmacs
---------------------------------------------------------------

Mule supports a wide variety of input methods.  There are three basic
classes: Lisp implementations, generic platform support, and library
interfaces.

   _Lisp implementations_ include Quail, which provides table-driven
input methods for almost all the character sets that Mule supports
(including all of the ISO 8859 family, the Indic languages, Thai, and
so on), and SKK, for Japanese.  (SKK also supports an interface to an
external "dictionary server" process.)  Quail supports both typical
"dead-key" methods (eg, in the "latin-1-prefix" method, `" a' produces
ä, LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS), and the complex
dictionary-based phonetic methods used for Asian ideographic languages
like Chinese.

   Lisp implementations can be less powerful (but they are not
perceptibly inefficient), and of course are not portable to non-Emacs
applications.  The incompatibility can be very annoying.  On the other
hand, they require no special platform support or external libraries,
so if you can display the characters, Mule can input them for you and
you can edit, anywhere.

   _Generic platform support_ is currently limited to the X Input
Method (XIM) framework, although support for MSIME (for MS Windows) is
planned, and IIIMF (Sun's Internet-Intranet Input Method Framework)
support is extremely desirable.  XIM is enabled at build time by use of
the `--with-xim' flag to `configure'.  For use of XIM, see your
platform documentation.  However, normally the input method you use is
specified via the `LANG' and `XMODIFIERS' environment variables.

   Of course, input skills are portable across most applications.
However, especially in modern GUI systems the habit of using bucky bits
has fallen into sad disuse, and many XIM systems are poorly configured
for use with Emacs.  For example, the kinput2 input manager (a separate
process providing an interface between Japanese dictionary servers such
as Canna and Wnn, and the application) tends to gobble up keystrokes
generating Meta characters.  This means that to edit while using an XIM
input method, you must toggle the input method off every time you want
to use `M-f'.  Your mileage may vary.

   _Library interfaces_ are most common for Japanese, although Wnn
supports Chinese (traditional and simplified) and Korean.  There are
Chinese and Korean input servers available, but we do not know of any
patches for XEmacs to use them directly.  You can use them via
IM-enabled terminals, by manipulating the terminal coding systems.  We
describe only the Japanese-oriented systems here.  The advantage of
these systems is that they are very powerful, and on platforms where
they are available there is typically a wide range of applications that
support them.  Thus your input skills are portable across applications.

   Mule provides built-in interfaces to the following input methods:
Wnn4, Wnn6, Canna, and SJ3.  These can be configured at build time.
There are patches available (no URL, sorry) to support the SKK server,
as well.  Wnn and SJ3 use the `egg' user interface.  The interface for
Canna is specialized to Canna.

   Wnn supports Japanese, Chinese and Korean. It is made by OMRON and
Kyôto University. It is a powerful and complex system.  Wnn4 is free
and Wnn6 is not.  Wnn uses grammatical hints and probability of word
association, so in principle Wnn can be cleverer than other methods.

   Canna, made by NEC, supports only Japanese.  It is a simple and
powerful system. Canna uses only grammar, but its grammar and
dictionary are quite sophisticated.  So for standard modern Japanese,
Canna seems cleverer than Wnn4. In addition, the UNIX version of Canna
is free (now there is a Microsoft Windows version).

   SJ3, by Sony, supports only Japanese.

   Egg consists of following parts:

  1. Input character Translation System (ITS) layer.  It translates
     ASCII inputs to Kana/PinYin/Hangul characters.

  2. Kana/PinYin/Hangul to Kanji transfer layer.  The interface layer
     to network Kana-Kanji server (Wnn and Sj3).

   These input methods are modal.  They have a raw (alphabet) mode, a
phonetic input mode, and Kana-Kanji transfer mode.  However there are
mode-less input methods for Egg and Canna.  `boiled-egg' is a mode-less
input method running on Egg.  For Canna, `canna.el' has a tiny
boiled-egg-like command, `(canna-boil)', and there are some
boiled-egg-like utilities.

   Much of this information was provided by MORIOKA Tomohiko

Q1.3.6: How do I portably code for MULE/XEmacs?
-----------------------------------------------

MULE has evolved rapidly over the last few years, and the original third
party patch (for GNU Emacs 19), GNU Emacs 20+, and XEmacs 20+ have quite
different implementations.  The APIs also vary although recent versions
of XEmacs have tended to converge to the GNU Emacs standard.

   MULE implementations are going to continue to evolve.  Both GNU Emacs
and XEmacs are working hard on Unicode support, which will involve new
APIs and probably variations on old ones.  For XEmacs 22, the old ISO
2022-based system for recognizing encodings will be replaced by a much
more flexible system, which should improve accuracy of automatic coding
detections, but will also involve new APIs.

   MORIOKA Tomohiko <morioka@jaist.ac.jp> writes:

     The application implementor must write separate code for these mule
     variants.  [Please don't hesitate to report these variants to us;
     they are not, strictly speaking, bugs, but they give third-party
     developers the same kind of creepy-crawly feeling.  We'll do what
     we can. - Ed.]

     MULE and the next version of Emacs are similar but the symbols are
     very different--requiring separate code as well.

     Namely we must support 3 kinds of mule variants and 4 or 5 or 6
     kinds of emacs variants... (;_;) I'm shocked, so I wrote a wrapper
     package called `emu' to provide a common interface.  [There is an
     XEmacs package of APEL which provides much more comprehensive
     coverage.  Be careful, however; APEL has problems of its own. -
     Ed.]

     I have the following suggestions about dealing with mule variants:

        * `(featurep 'mule)' `t' on all mule variants

        * `(boundp 'MULE)' is `t' on only MULE.  Maybe the next version
          of Emacs will not have this symbol.

        * MULE has a variable `mule-version'.  Perhaps the next version
          of Emacs will have this variable as well.

     Following is a sample to distinguish mule variants:

          (if (featurep 'mule)
              (cond ((boundp 'MULE)
                     ;; for original Mule
                     )
                    ((string-match "XEmacs" emacs-version)
                     ;; for XEmacs with Mule
                     )
                    (t

Q1.3.8: Does XEmacs support Unicode?
------------------------------------

Partially, as an external encoding for files, processes, and terminals.
It does not yet support Unicode fonts *Note Does XEmacs support Unicode
Fonts?: Q1.3.9

   To get Unicode support, you need a Mule-enabled XEmacs.  Install
Mule-UCS from packages in the usual way.  Put

     (require 'un-define)
     (set-coding-priority-list '(utf-8))
     (set-coding-category-system 'utf-8 'utf-8)

   in your init file to enable the UTF-8 coding system.  You may wish to
view the documentation of `set-coding-priority-list' if you find that
files that are not UTF-8 are being mis-recognized as UTF-8.

   Install standard national fonts (not Unicode fonts) for all
character sets you use.  See *Note Q1.3.9::.

   Mule-UCS also supports 16-bit forms of Unicode (UTF-16).  It does not
support 31-bit forms of Unicode (UTF-32 or UCS-4).

Q1.3.9: How does XEmacs display Unicode?
----------------------------------------

Mule doesn't have a Unicode charset internally, so there's nothing to
bind a Unicode registry to.  It would not be straightforward to create,
either, because Unicode is not ISO 2022-compatible.  You'd have to
translate it to multiple 96x96 pages.

   This means that Mule-UCS uses ordinary national fonts for display.
This is not really a problem, except for those languages that use the
Unified Han characters.  The problem here is that Mule-UCS maps from
Unicode code points to national character sets in a deterministic way.
By default, this means that Japanese fonts are tried first, then
Chinese, then Korean.  To change the priority ordering, use the command
`un-define-change-charset-order'.

   It also means you can't use Unicode fonts directly, at least not
without extreme hackery.  You can run -nw with
(set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8) if you really want a Unicode font
for some reason.

   Real Unicode support will be introduced in XEmacs 22.0.

1.4: Getting Started, Backing up & Recovery
===========================================

Q1.4.1: What is an `init.el' or `.emacs' and is there a sample one?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The `init.el' or `.emacs' file is used to customize XEmacs to your
tastes.  Starting in 21.4, the preferred location for the init file is
`~/.xemacs/init.el'; in previous versions, it was `~/.emacs'.  21.4
still accepts the old location, but the first time you run it, it will
ask to migrate your file to the new location.  If you answer yes, the
file will be moved, and a "compatibility" `.emacs' file will be placed
in the old location so that you can still run older versions of XEmacs,
and versions of GNU Emacs, which expect the old location.  The `.emacs'
file present is just a stub that loads the real file in
`~/.xemacs/init.el'.

   No two init files are alike, nor are they expected to be alike, but
that's the point.  The XEmacs distribution contains an excellent starter
example in the `etc/' directory called `sample.init.el' (starting in
21.4) or `sample.emacs' in older versions.  Copy this file from there
to `~/.xemacs/init.el' (starting in 21.4) or `~/.emacs' in older
versions, where `~' means your home directory, of course.  Then edit it
to suit.

   You may bring the `sample.init.el' or `sample.emacs' file into an
XEmacs buffer from the menubar. (The menu entry for it is always under
the `Help' menu, but its location under that has changed in various
versions.  Recently, look under the `Samples' submenu.)  To determine
the location of the `etc/' directory type the command `C-h v
data-directory <RET>'.

Q1.4.2: Can I use the same `init.el'/`.emacs' with the other Emacs?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.  The sample `init.el'/`.emacs' included in the XEmacs distribution
will show you how to handle different versions and flavors of Emacs.

Q1.4.3: Any good tutorials around?
----------------------------------

There's the XEmacs tutorial available from the Help Menu under
`Basics->Tutorials', or by typing `C-h t'. To check whether it's
available in a non-english language, type `C-u C-h t TAB', type the
first letters of your preferred language, then type <RET>.

Q1.4.4: May I see an example of a useful XEmacs Lisp function?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following function does a little bit of everything useful.  It does
something with the prefix argument, it examines the text around the
cursor, and it's interactive so it may be bound to a key.  It inserts
copies of the current word the cursor is sitting on at the cursor.  If
you give it a prefix argument: `C-u 3 M-x double-word' then it will
insert 3 copies.

     (defun double-word (count)
       "Insert a copy of the current word underneath the cursor"
       (interactive "*p")
       (let (here there string)
         (save-excursion
           (forward-word -1)
           (setq here (point))
           (forward-word 1)
           (setq there (point))
           (setq string (buffer-substring here there)))
         (while (>= count 1)
           (insert string)
           (decf count))))

   The best way to see what is going on here is to let XEmacs tell you.
Put the code into an XEmacs buffer, and do a `C-h f' with the cursor
sitting just to the right of the function you want explained.  Eg.  move
the cursor to the SPACE between `interactive' and `"*p"' and hit `C-h
f' to see what the function `interactive' does.  Doing this will tell
you that the `*' requires a writable buffer, and `p' converts the
prefix argument to a number, and `interactive' allows you to execute
the command with `M-x'.

Q1.4.5: And how do I bind it to a key?
--------------------------------------

To bind to a key do:

     (global-set-key "\C-cd" 'double-word)

   Or interactively, `M-x global-set-key' and follow the prompts.

Q1.4.6: What's the difference between a macro and a function?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Quoting from the Lisp Reference (a.k.a "Lispref") Manual:

   "Macros" enable you to define new control constructs and other
language features.  A macro is defined much like a function, but instead
of telling how to compute a value, it tells how to compute another Lisp
expression which will in turn compute the value.  We call this
expression the "expansion" of the macro.

   Macros can do this because they operate on the unevaluated
expressions for the arguments, not on the argument values as functions
do.  They can therefore construct an expansion containing these
argument expressions or parts of them.

   Do not confuse the two terms with "keyboard macros", which are
another matter, entirely.  A keyboard macro is a key bound to several
other keys.  Refer to manual for details.

2.0: Installation
=================

Q2.0.1: Running XEmacs without installing
-----------------------------------------

How can I just try XEmacs without installing it?

   XEmacs will run in place without requiring installation and copying
of the Lisp directories, and without having to specify a special
build-time flag.  It's the copying of the Lisp directories that
requires so much space.  XEmacs is largely written in Lisp.

   A good method is to make a shell alias for xemacs:

     alias xemacs=/i/xemacs-20.2/src/xemacs

   (You will obviously use whatever directory you downloaded the source
tree to instead of `/i/xemacs-20.2').

   This will let you run XEmacs without massive copying.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q2.0.2,  Next: Q2.0.3,  Prev: Q2.0.1,  Up: Installation

Q2.0.2: XEmacs is too big
-------------------------

The space required by the installation directories can be reduced
dramatically if desired.  Gzip all the .el files.  Remove all the
packages you'll never want to use.  Remove the TexInfo manuals.  Remove
the Info (and use just hardcopy versions of the manual).  Remove most
of the stuff in etc.  Remove or gzip all the source code.  Gzip or
remove the C source code.  Configure it so that copies are not made of
the support lisp.

   These are all Emacs Lisp source code and bytecompiled object code.
You may safely gzip everything named *.el here.  You may remove any
package you don't use.  _Nothing bad will happen if you delete a package
that you do not use_.  You must be sure you do not use it though, so be
conservative at first.

   Any package with the possible exceptions of xemacs-base, and EFS are
candidates for removal.  Ask yourself, _Do I ever want to use this
package?_  If the answer is no, then it is a candidate for removal.

   First, gzip all the .el files.  Then go about package by package and
start gzipping the .elc files.  Then run XEmacs and do whatever it is
you normally do.  If nothing bad happens, then remove the package.  You
can remove a package via the PUI interface (`M-x pui-list-packages',
then press `d' to mark the packages you wish to delete, and then `x' to
delete them.

   Another method is to do `M-x package-get-delete-package'.

Q2.0.3: Compiling XEmacs with Netaudio.
---------------------------------------

What is the best way to compile XEmacs with the netaudio system, since I
have got the netaudio system compiled but installed at a weird place, I
am not root.  Also in the READMEs it does not say anything about
compiling with the audioserver?

   You should only need to add some stuff to the configure command line.
To tell it to compile in netaudio support: `--with-sound=both', or
`--with-sound=nas' if you don't want native sound support for some
reason.) To tell it where to find the netaudio includes and libraries:

     --site-libraries=WHATEVER
     --site-includes=WHATEVER

   Then (fingers crossed) it should compile and it will use netaudio if
you have a server running corresponding to the X server. The netaudio
server has to be there when XEmacs starts. If the netaudio server goes
away and another is run, XEmacs should cope (fingers crossed, error
handling in netaudio isn't perfect).

   BTW, netaudio has been renamed as it has a name clash with something
else, so if you see references to NAS or Network Audio System, it's the
same thing.  It also might be found at
`ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/audio/nas/'.

Q2.0.6: I'm having strange crashes.  What do I do?
--------------------------------------------------

There have been a variety of reports of crashes due to compilers with
buggy optimizers.  Please see the `PROBLEMS' file that comes with
XEmacs to read what it says about your platform.

   If you compiled XEmacs using `--use-union-type' (or the option
`USE_UNION_TYPE' in `config.inc' under Windows), try recompiling again
without it.  The union type has been known to trigger compiler errors
in a number of cases.

Q2.0.8: can't resolve symbol _h_errno
-------------------------------------

You are using the Linux/ELF distribution of XEmacs 19.14, and your ELF
libraries are out of date.  You have the following options:

  1. Upgrade your libc to at least 5.2.16 (better is 5.2.18, 5.3.12, or
     5.4.10).

  2. Patch the XEmacs binary by replacing all occurrences of
     `_h_errno^@' with `h_errno^@^@'.  Any version of Emacs will
     suffice.  If you don't understand how to do this, don't do it.

  3. Rebuild XEmacs yourself--any working ELF version of libc should be
     O.K.

   Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@xemacs.org> writes:

     Why not use a Perl one-liner for No. 2?

          perl -pi -e 's/_h_errno\0/h_errno\0\0/g' \

     NB: You _must_ patch `/usr/local/bin/xemacs-19.14', and not
     `xemacs' because `xemacs' is a link to `xemacs-19.14'; the Perl
     `-i' option will cause unwanted side-effects if applied to a
     symbolic link.

     beta is v3.4b035.  There is a HOWTO here.

PNG
     `ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/'.  0.89c is current.  XEmacs
     requires a fairly recent version to avoid using temporary files.

Compface

Q2.0.10: After I run configure I find a core dump, is something wrong?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Not necessarily.  If you have GNU sed 3.0 you should downgrade it to
2.05.  From the `README' at prep.ai.mit.edu:

     sed 3.0 has been withdrawn from distribution.  It has major
     revisions, which mostly seem to be improvements; but it turns out
     to have bugs too which cause trouble in some common cases.

     Tom Lord won't be able to work fixing the bugs until May.  So in
     the mean time, we've decided to withdraw sed 3.0 from distribution
     and make version 2.05 once again the recommended version.

   It has also been observed that the vfork test on Solaris will leave a
core dump.

Q2.0.11: XEmacs doesn't resolve hostnames.
------------------------------------------

This is the result of a long-standing problem with SunOS and the fact
that stock SunOS systems do not ship with DNS resolver code in libc.

   Christopher Davis <ckd@loiosh.kei.com> writes:

     That's correct [The SunOS 4.1.3 precompiled binaries don't do name
     lookup].  Since Sun figured that everyone used NIS to do name
     lookups (that DNS thing was apparently only a passing fad,
     right?), the stock SunOS 4.x systems don't have DNS-based name
     lookups in libc.

     This is also why Netscape ships two binaries for SunOS 4.1.x.

     The best solution is to compile it yourself; the configure script
     will check to see if you've put DNS in the shared libc and will
     then proceed to link against the DNS resolver library code.

Q2.0.12: Why can't I strip XEmacs?
----------------------------------

Richard Cognot <cognot@fronsac.ensg.u-nancy.fr> writes:

     Because of the way XEmacs (and every other Emacsen, AFAIK) is
     built. The link gives you a bare-boned emacs (called temacs).
     temacs is then run, preloading some of the lisp files. The result
     is then dumped into a new executable, named xemacs, which will
     contain all of the preloaded lisp functions and data.

     Now, during the dump itself, the executable (code+data+symbols) is
     written on disk using a special unexec() function. This function is
     obviously heavily system dependent. And on some systems, it leads
     to an executable which, although valid, cannot be stripped without
     damage. If memory serves, this is especially the case for AIX
     binaries. On other architectures it might work OK.

     The Right Way to strip the emacs binary is to strip temacs prior to
     dumping xemacs. This will always work, although you can do that
     only if you install from sources (as temacs is `not' part of the
     binary kits).

   Nat Makarevitch <nat@nataa.fr.eu.org> writes:

     Here is the trick:

Q2.0.13: I don't need no steenkin' packages.  Do I?
---------------------------------------------------

Strictly speaking, no.  XEmacs will build and install just fine without
any packages installed.  However, only the most basic editing functions
will be available with no packages installed, so installing packages is
an essential part of making your installed XEmacs _useful_.

Q2.0.14: How do I figure out which packages to install?
-------------------------------------------------------

Many people really liked the old way that packages were bundled and do
not want to mess with packages at all.  You can grab all the packages at
once like you used to with old XEmacs versions.  Download the file

   `xemacs-sumo.tar.gz'

   For an XEmacs compiled with Mule you also need

   `xemacs-mule-sumo.tar.gz'

   from the `packages' directory on your XEmacs mirror archive.  N.B.
They are called 'Sumo Tarballs' for good reason. They are currently
about 15MB and 2.3MB (gzipped) respectively.

   Install them by

   `cd $prefix/lib/xemacs ; gunzip -c <tarballname> | tar xf -'

   See README.packages for more detailed installation instructions.

   As the Sumo tarballs are not regenerated as often as the individual
packages, it is recommended that you use the automatic package tools
afterwards to pick up any recent updates.

A typical error: FTP Error: USER request failed; 500 AUTH not

   Thanks to giacomo boffi <giacomo.boffi@polimi.it> who recommends on
comp.emacs.xemacs:

   tell your ftp client to not attempt AUTH authentication (or do not
use FTP servers that don't understand AUTH)

   and notes that you need to add an element (often "-u") to
`efs-ftp-program-args'.  Use M-x customize-variable, and verify the
needed flag with `man ftp' or other local documentation.

Q2.0.16: Cygwin XEmacs won't start: cygXpm-noX4.dll was not found (NEW)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cygwin binary distributed with the netinstaller uses an external DLL
to handle XPM images (such as toolbar buttons).  You may get an error
like

   This application has failed to start because cygXpm-noX4.dll was not
found.      Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

   Andy Piper <andy@xemacs.org> sez:

   cygXpm-noX4 is part of the cygwin distribution under libraries or
graphics, but is not installed by default. You need to run the
cygwin setup again and select this package.

   Ie, reinstalling XEmacs won't help because it is not part of the
XEmacs distribution.

2.1: Trouble Shooting
=====================

Q2.1.1: Help!  XEmacs just crashed on me!
-----------------------------------------

First of all, don't panic.  Whenever XEmacs crashes, it tries extremely
hard to auto-save all of your files before dying.  (The main time that
this will not happen is if the machine physically lost power or if you
killed the XEmacs process using `kill -9').  The next time you try to
edit those files, you will be informed that a more recent auto-save
file exists.  You can use `M-x recover-file' to retrieve the auto-saved
version of the file.

   You can use the command `M-x recover-session' after a crash to pick
up where you left off.

   Now, XEmacs is not perfect, and there may occasionally be times, or
particular sequences of actions, that cause it to crash.  If you can
come up with a reproducible way of doing this (or even if you have a
pretty good memory of exactly what you were doing at the time), the
maintainers would be very interested in knowing about it.  The best way
to report a bug is using `M-x report-emacs-bug' (or by selecting `Send
Bug Report...' from the Help menu).  If that won't work (e.g. you can't
get XEmacs working at all), send ordinary mail to <crashes@xemacs.org>.
_MAKE SURE_ to include the output from the crash, especially including
the Lisp backtrace, as well as the XEmacs configuration from `M-x
describe-installation' (or equivalently, the file `Installation' in the
top of the build tree).  Please note that the `crashes' address is
exclusively for crash reports.  The best way to report bugs in general
is through the `M-x report-emacs-bug' interface just mentioned, or if
necessary by emailing <xemacs-beta@xemacs.org>.  Note that the
developers do _not_ usually follow `comp.emacs.xemacs' on a regular
basis; thus, this is better for general questions about XEmacs than bug
reports.

   If at all possible, include a C stack backtrace of the core dump that
was produced.  This shows where exactly things went wrong, and makes it
much easier to diagnose problems.  To do this under Unix, you need to
locate the core file (it's called `core', and is usually sitting in the
directory that you started XEmacs from, or your home directory if that
other directory was not writable).  Then, go to that directory and
execute a command like:

     gdb `which xemacs` core

   and then issue the command `where' to get the stack backtrace.  You
might have to use `dbx' or some similar debugger in place of `gdb'.  If
you don't have any such debugger available, complain to your system
administrator.

   It's possible that a core file didn't get produced, in which case
you're out of luck.  Go complain to your system administrator and tell
him not to disable core files by default.  Also see *Note Q2.1.15::,
for tips and techniques for dealing with a debugger.

   If you're under Microsoft Windows, you're out of luck unless you
happen to have a debugging aid installed on your system, for example
Visual C++.  In this case, the crash will result in a message giving
you the option to enter a debugger (for example, by pressing `Cancel').
Do this and locate the stack-trace window. (If your XEmacs was built
without debugging information, the stack trace may not be very useful.)

   When making a problem report make sure that:

  1. Report *all* of the information output by XEmacs during the crash.

  2. You mention what O/S & Hardware you are running XEmacs on.

  3. What version of XEmacs you are running.

  4. What build options you are using.

  5. If the problem is related to graphics and you are running Unix, we
     will also need to know what version of the X Window System you are
     running, and what window manager you are using.

  6. If the problem happened on a TTY, please include the terminal type.

   Much of the information above is automatically generated by `M-x
report-emacs-bug'.  Even more, and often useful, information can be
generated by redirecting the output of `make' and `make check' to a
file (`beta.err' is the default used by `build-report'), and executing
`M-x build-report'.

Q2.1.2: Cryptic Minibuffer messages.
------------------------------------

When I try to use some particular option of some particular package, I
get a cryptic error in the minibuffer.

   If you can't figure out what's going on, select Options/General
Options/Debug on Error from the Menubar and then try and make the error
happen again.  This will give you a backtrace that may be enlightening.
If not, try reading through this FAQ; if that fails, you could try
posting to comp.emacs.xemacs (making sure to include the backtrace) and
someone may be able to help.  If you can identify which Emacs lisp
source file the error is coming from you can get a more detailed stack
backtrace by doing the following:

  1. Visit the .el file in an XEmacs buffer.

  2. Issue the command `M-x eval-current-buffer'.

  3. Reproduce the error.

   Depending on the version of XEmacs, you may either select View->Show
Message Log (recent versions), Edit->Show Messages (some earlier
versions) or Help->Recent Keystrokes/Messages (other earlier versions)
from the menubar to see the most recent messages.  This command is bound
to `C-h l' by default.

Q2.1.3: Translation Table Syntax messages at Startup
----------------------------------------------------

I get tons of translation table syntax error messages during startup.
How do I get rid of them?

   There are two causes of this problem.  The first usually only strikes
people using the prebuilt binaries.  The culprit in both cases is the
file `XKeysymDB'.

   * The binary cannot find the `XKeysymDB' file.  The location is
     hardcoded at compile time so if the system the binary was built on
     puts it a different place than your system does, you have
     problems.  To fix, set the environment variable `XKEYSYMDB' to the
     location of the `XKeysymDB' file on your system or to the location
     of the one included with XEmacs which should be at
     `<xemacs_root_directory>/lib/xemacs-19.16/etc/XKeysymDB'.

   * The binary is finding the XKeysymDB but it is out-of-date on your
     system and does not contain the necessary lines.  Either ask your
     system administrator to replace it with the one which comes with
     XEmacs (which is the stock R6 version and is backwards compatible)
     or set your `XKEYSYMDB' variable to the location of XEmacs's
     described above.

Q2.1.4: Startup warnings about deducing proper fonts?
-----------------------------------------------------

How can I avoid the startup warnings about deducing proper fonts?

   This is highly dependent on your installation, but try with the
following font as your base font for XEmacs and see what it does:

-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

   More precisely, do the following in your resource file:

Emacs.default.attributeFont: \
-adobe-courier-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

   If you just don't want to see the `*Warnings*' buffer at startup
time, you can set this:

     (setq display-warning-minimum-level 'error)

   The buffer still exists; it just isn't in your face.

     With the new colors installed the problem still occurs if the above
     resources are not defined.

     If the new colors are not present then an additional error occurs
     on XEmacs startup, which says `Color Red3' not defined.

Q2.1.15: How to debug an XEmacs problem with a debugger
-------------------------------------------------------

If XEmacs does crash on you, one of the most productive things you can
do to help get the bug fixed is to poke around a bit with the debugger.
Here are some hints:

   * First of all, if the crash is at all reproducible, consider very
     strongly recompiling your XEmacs with debugging symbols and with no
     optimization (e.g. with GCC use the compiler flags `-g -O0' -
     that's an "oh" followed by a zero), and with the configure options
     `--debug=yes' and `--error-checking=all'.  This will make your
     XEmacs run somewhat slower, but you are a lot more likely to catch
     the problem earlier (closer to its source).  It makes it a lot
     easier to determine what's going on with a debugger.

   * If it's not a true crash (_i.e._, XEmacs is hung, or a zombie
     process), or it's inconvenient to run XEmacs again because XEmacs
     is already running or is running in batch mode as part of a bunch
     of scripts, you may be able to attach to the existing process with
     your debugger.  Most debuggers let you do this by substituting the
     process ID for the core file when you invoke the debugger from the
     command line, or by using the `attach' command or something
     similar.

   * If you're able to run XEmacs under a debugger and reproduce the
     crash, here are some things you can do:

   * If XEmacs is hitting an assertion failure, put a breakpoint on
     `assert_failed()'.

   * If XEmacs is hitting some weird Lisp error that's causing it to
     crash (e.g. during startup), put a breakpoint on
     `signal_1()'--this is declared static in eval.c.

   * If XEmacs is outputting lots of X errors, put a breakpoint on
     `x_error_handler()'; that will tell you which call is causing them.

   * Internally, you will probably see lots of variables that hold
     objects of type `Lisp_Object'.  These are references to Lisp
     objects.  Printing them out with the debugger probably won't be too
     useful--you'll likely just see a number.  To decode them, do this:

          call dp (OBJECT)

     where OBJECT is whatever you want to decode (it can be a variable,
     a function call, etc.).  This uses the Lisp printing routines to
     out a readable representation on the TTY from which the xemacs
     process was invoked.

   * If you want to get a Lisp backtrace showing the Lisp call stack,
     do this:

          call db ()

   * Using `dp' and `db' has two disadvantages - they can only be used
     with a running (including hung or zombie) xemacs process, and they
     do not display the internal C structure of a Lisp Object.  Even if
     all you've got is a core dump, all is not lost.

     If you're using GDB, there are some macros in the file
     `src/.gdbinit' in the XEmacs source distribution that should make
     it easier for you to decode Lisp objects.  This file is
     automatically read by gdb if gdb is run in the directory where
     xemacs was built, and contains these useful macros to inspect the
     state of xemacs:

    `pobj'
          Usage: pobj lisp_object
          Print the internal C representation of a lisp object.

    `xtype'
          Usage: xtype lisp_object
          Print the Lisp type of a lisp object.

    `lbt'
          Usage: lbt
          Print the current Lisp stack trace.  Requires a running
          xemacs process.  (It works by calling the db routine
          described above.)

    `ldp'
          Usage: ldp lisp_object
          Print a Lisp Object value using the Lisp printer.  Requires a
          running xemacs process.  (It works by calling the dp routine
          described above.)

    `run-temacs'
          Usage: run-temacs
          Run temacs interactively, like xemacs.  Use this with
          debugging tools (like purify) that cannot deal with dumping,
          or when temacs builds successfully, but xemacs does not.

    `dump-temacs'
          Usage: dump-temacs
          Run the dumping part of the build procedure.  Use when
          debugging temacs, not xemacs!  Use this when temacs builds
          successfully, but xemacs does not.

    `check-xemacs'
          Usage: check-xemacs
          Run the test suite.  Equivalent to 'make check'.

    `check-temacs'
          Usage: check-temacs
          Run the test suite on temacs.  Equivalent to 'make
          check-temacs'.  Use this with debugging tools (like purify)
          that cannot deal with dumping, or when temacs builds
          successfully, but xemacs does not.

     If you are using Sun's `dbx' debugger, there is an equivalent file
     `src/.dbxrc', which defines the same commands for dbx.

   * If you're using a debugger to get a C stack backtrace and you're
     seeing stack traces with some of the innermost frames mangled, it
     may be due to dynamic linking. (This happens especially under
     Linux.) Consider reconfiguring with `--dynamic=no'.  Also,
     sometimes (again under Linux), stack backtraces of core dumps will
     have the frame where the fatal signal occurred mangled; if you can
     obtain a stack trace while running the XEmacs process under a
     debugger, the stack trace should be clean.

     Curtiss <1CMC3466@ibm.mtsac.edu> suggests upgrading to ld.so
     version 1.8 if dynamic linking and debugging is a problem on Linux.

   * If you're using a debugger to get a C stack backtrace and you're
     getting a completely mangled and bogus stack trace, it's probably
     due to one of the following:

       a. Your executable has been stripped.  Bad news.  Tell your
          sysadmin not to do this--it doesn't accomplish anything
          except to save a bit of disk space, and makes debugging much
          much harder.

       b. Your stack is getting trashed.  Debugging this is hard; you
          have to do a binary-search type of narrowing down where the
          crash occurs, until you figure out exactly which line is
          causing the problem.  Of course, this only works if the bug
          is highly reproducible.  Also, in many cases if you run
          XEmacs from the debugger, the debugger can protect the stack
          somewhat.  However, if the stack is being smashed, it is
          typically the case that there is a wild pointer somewhere in
          the program, often quite far from where the crash occurs.

       c. If your stack trace has exactly one frame in it, with address
          0x0, this could simply mean that XEmacs attempted to execute
          code at that address, e.g. through jumping to a null function
          pointer.  Unfortunately, under those circumstances, GDB under
          Linux doesn't know how to get a stack trace. (Yes, this is
          the fourth Linux-related problem I've mentioned.  I have no
          idea why GDB under Linux is so bogus.  Complain to the GDB
          authors, or to comp.os.linux.development.system.) Again,
          you'll have to use the narrowing-down process described above.

       d. You will get a Lisp backtrace output when XEmacs crashes, so
          you'll have something useful.


   * If you compile with the newer gcc variants gcc-2.8 or egcs, you
     will also need gdb 4.17 or above.  Earlier releases of gdb can't
     handle the debug information generated by the newer compilers.

   * In versions of XEmacs before 21.2.27, `src/.gdbinit' was named
     `src/gdbinit'.  This had the disadvantage of not being sourced
     automatically by gdb, so you had to set that up yourself.

   * If you are running Microsoft Windows, the the file `nt/README' for
     further information about debugging XEmacs.

Q2.1.17: `Marker does not point anywhere'
-----------------------------------------

As with other errors, set `debug-on-error' to `t' to get the backtrace
when the error occurs.  Specifically, two problems have been reported
(and fixed).

  1. A problem with line-number-mode in XEmacs 19.14 affected a large
     number of other packages.  If you see this error message, turn off
     line-number-mode.

  2. A problem with some early versions of Gnus 5.4 caused this error.
     Upgrade your Gnus.

Q2.1.19: XEmacs does not follow the local timezone.
---------------------------------------------------

When using one of the prebuilt binaries many users have observed that
XEmacs uses the timezone under which it was built, but not the timezone
under which it is running.  The solution is to add:

     (set-time-zone-rule "MET")

   to your `init.el'/`.emacs' or the `site-start.el' file if you can.
Replace `MET' with your local timezone.

Q2.1.22: XEmacs seems to take a really long time to do some things
------------------------------------------------------------------

David Moore <dmoore@ucsd.edu> writes:

     Two things you can do:

     1) C level:

     When you see it going mad like this, you might want to use gdb
     from an 'xterm' to attach to the running process and get a stack
     trace.  To do this just run:

          gdb /path/to/xemacs/xemacs ####

     Where `####' is the process id of your xemacs, instead of
     specifying the core.  When gdb attaches, the xemacs will stop [1]
     and you can type `where' in gdb to get a stack trace as usual.  To
     get things moving again, you can just type `quit' in gdb.  It'll
     tell you the program is running and ask if you want to quit
     anyways.  Say 'y' and it'll quit and have your emacs continue from
     where it was at.

     2) Lisp level:

     Turn on debug-on-quit early on.  When you think things are going
     slow hit C-g and it may pop you in the debugger so you can see
     what routine is running.  Press `c' to get going again.

     debug-on-quit doesn't work if something's turned on inhibit-quit
     or in some other strange cases.

Movemail used to work fine in 19.14 but has stopped working in 19.15

   SL Baur <steve@xemacs.org> writes:

     Movemail on Linux used to default to using flock file locking.
     With 19.15 and later versions it now defaults to using `.lock' file
     locking.  If this is not appropriate for your system, edit
     src/s/linux.h and uncomment the line that reads:

          #define MAIL_USE_FLOCK

Q2.1.24:  XEmacs won't start without network.
---------------------------------------------

If XEmacs starts when you're on the network, but fails when you're not
on the network, you may be missing a "localhost" entry in your
`/etc/hosts' file.  The file should contain an entry like:

     127.0.0.1        localhost

   Add that line, and XEmacs will be happy.

Q2.1.25::  After upgrading, XEmacs won't do `foo' any more!
-----------------------------------------------------------

You have been used to doing `foo', but now when you invoke it (or click
the toolbar button or select the menu item), nothing (or an error)
happens.  The simplest explanation is that you are missing a package
that is essential to you.  You can either track it down and install it
(there is a list of packages and brief descriptions of their contents in
`etc/PACKAGES'), or install the `Sumo Tarball' (*note Q2.0.14::).

3.0: Customization - Emacs Lisp and `init.el'/`.emacs'
======================================================

Q3.0.1: What version of Emacs am I running?
-------------------------------------------

How can `init.el'/`.emacs' determine which of the family of Emacsen I
am using?

   To determine if you are currently running GNU Emacs 18, GNU Emacs 19,
XEmacs 19, XEmacs 20, or Epoch, and use appropriate code, check out the
example given in `etc/sample.init.el' (`etc/sample.emacs' in XEmacs
versions prior to 21.4).  There are other nifty things in there as well!

   For all new code, all you really need to do is:

     (defvar running-xemacs (string-match "XEmacs\\|Lucid" emacs-version))


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q3.0.2,  Next: Q3.0.3,  Prev: Q3.0.1,  Up: Customization

Q3.0.2: How can I evaluate Emacs-Lisp expressions?
--------------------------------------------------

I know I can evaluate Elisp expressions from `*scratch*' buffer with
`C-j' after the expression.  How do I do it from another buffer?

   Press `M-:' (the default binding of `eval-expression'), and enter
the expression to the minibuffer.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q3.0.3,  Next: Q3.0.4,  Prev: Q3.0.2,  Up: Customization

Q3.0.3: `(setq tab-width 6)' behaves oddly.
-------------------------------------------

If you put `(setq tab-width 6)' in your `init.el'/`.emacs' file it does
not work!  Is there a reason for this?  If you do it at the EVAL prompt
it works fine!! How strange.

   Use `setq-default' instead, since `tab-width' is all-buffer-local.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q3.0.4,  Next: Q3.0.5,  Prev: Q3.0.3,  Up: Customization

Q3.0.4: How can I add directories to the `load-path'?
-----------------------------------------------------

Here are two ways to do that, one that puts your directories at the
front of the load-path, the other at the end:

     ;;; Add things at the beginning of the load-path, do not add
     ;;; duplicate directories:
     (pushnew "bar" load-path :test 'equal)
     
     (pushnew "foo" load-path :test 'equal)
     
     ;;; Add things at the end, unconditionally
     (setq load-path (nconc load-path '("foo" "bar")))

   keith (k.p.) hanlan <keithh@nortel.ca> writes:

     To add directories using Unix shell metacharacters use
     `expand-file-name' like this:

          (push (expand-file-name "~keithh/.emacsdir") load-path)


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q3.0.5,  Next: Q3.0.6,  Prev: Q3.0.4,  Up: Customization

Q3.0.5: How to check if a lisp function is defined?
---------------------------------------------------

Use the following elisp:

     (fboundp 'foo)

   It's almost always a mistake to test `emacs-version' or any similar
variables.

   Instead, use feature-tests, such as `featurep', `boundp', `fboundp',
or even simple behavioral tests, eg.:

     (defvar foo-old-losing-code-p
       (condition-case nil (progn (losing-code t) nil)
         (wrong-number-of-arguments t)))

   There is an incredible amount of broken code out there which could
work much better more often in more places if it did the above instead
of trying to divine its environment from the value of one variable.

Q3.0.6: Can I force the output of `(face-list)' to a buffer?
------------------------------------------------------------

It would be good having it in a buffer, as the output of `(face-list)'
is too wide to fit to a minibuffer.

   Evaluate the expression in the `*scratch*' buffer with point after
the rightmost paren and typing `C-j'.

   If the minibuffer smallness is the only problem you encounter, you
can simply press `C-h l' to get the former minibuffer contents in a
buffer.

John Mann <mannj@ll.mit.edu> writes:

     You have to go to Options->Frame Appearance and unselect
     `Frame-Local Font Menu'.  If this option is selected, font changes
     are only applied to the _current_ frame and do _not_ get saved

   Also, set the following in your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (setq options-save-faces t)

Q3.0.8: How do I get a single minibuffer frame?
-----------------------------------------------

Vin Shelton <acs@acm.org> writes:

     (setq initial-frame-plist '(minibuffer nil))
     (setq default-frame-plist '(minibuffer nil))
     (setq default-minibuffer-frame
           (make-frame
            '(minibuffer only

                         has-modeline-p nil)))

   *Please note:* The single minibuffer frame may not be to everyone's
taste, and there any number of other XEmacs options settings that may
make it difficult or inconvenient to use.

Q3.0.9: What is `Customize'?
----------------------------

Starting with XEmacs 20.2 there is new system 'Customize' for
customizing XEmacs options.

   You can access `Customize' from the `Options' menu or invoking one
of customize commands by typing eg.  `M-x customize', `M-x
customize-face', `M-x customize-variable' or `M-x customize-apropos'.

   Starting with XEmacs 20.3 there is also new `browser' mode for
Customize.  Try it out with `M-x customize-browse'

3.1: X Window System & Resources
================================

Q3.1.1: Where is a list of X resources?
---------------------------------------

Search through the `NEWS' file for `X Resources'.  A fairly
comprehensive list is given after it.

   In addition, an `app-defaults' file `etc/Emacs.ad' is supplied,
listing the defaults.  The file `etc/sample.Xresources' gives a
different set of defaults that you might consider for installation in
your `~/.Xresources' file.  It is nearly the same as `etc/Emacs.ad',
but a few entries are altered.  Be careful about installing the
contents of this file into your `.Xresources' (or legacy `.Xdefaults')
file if you use GNU Emacs under X11 as well.

       (set-face-foreground  'font-lock-comment-face "Grey")
       (set-face-foreground  'font-lock-string-face  "Red")

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to have the window title area display the full directory/name
of the current buffer file and not just the name.

   Add the following line to your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (setq frame-title-format "%S: %f")

   A more sophisticated title might be:

     (setq frame-title-format
           '("%S: " (buffer-file-name "%f"
                                      (dired-directory dired-directory "%b"))))

   That is, use the file name, or the dired-directory, or the buffer
name.

according to xprop, is `junk'.  This is the way it's supposed to work,
I think.  When I run `xemacs -name junk' the class name is not set to
`junk'.  It's still `emacs'.  What does `xemacs -name' really do?  The
reason I ask is that my window manager (fvwm) will make a window sticky
and I use XEmacs to read my mail.  I want that XEmacs window to be
sticky, without having to use the window manager's function to set the
window sticky.  What gives?

   `xemacs -name' sets the application name for the program (that is,
the thing which normally comes from `argv[0]').  Using `-name' is the
same as making a copy of the executable with that new name.  The
`WM_CLASS' property on each frame is set to the frame-name, and the
application-class.  So, if you did `xemacs -name FOO' and then created
a frame named BAR, you'd get an X window with WM_CLASS = `( "BAR",
"Emacs")'.  However, the resource hierarchy for this widget would be:

     Name:    FOO   .shell             .container   .BAR
     Class:   Emacs .TopLevelEmacsShell.EmacsManager.EmacsFrame

   instead of the default

     Name:    xemacs.shell             .container   .emacs
     Class:   Emacs .TopLevelEmacsShell.EmacsManager.EmacsFrame

   It is arguable that the first element of WM_CLASS should be set to
the application-name instead of the frame-name, but I think that's less
flexible, since it does not give you the ability to have multiple frames
with different WM_CLASS properties.  Another possibility would be for
the default frame name to come from the application name instead of
simply being `emacs'.  However, at this point, making that change would
be troublesome: it would mean that many users would have to make yet
another change to their resource files (since the default frame name
would suddenly change from `emacs' to `xemacs', or whatever the
executable happened to be named), so we'd rather avoid it.

   To make a frame with a particular name use:

     (make-frame '((name . "the-name")))

Q3.2.2: How do I set the text, menu and modeline fonts?
-------------------------------------------------------

Note that you should use `Emacs.' and not `Emacs*' when setting face
values.

   In `.Xresources':

     Emacs.default.attributeFont:  -*-*-medium-r-*-*-*-120-*-*-m-*-*-*
     Emacs*menubar*font:           fixed
     Emacs.modeline.attributeFont: fixed

   This is confusing because `default' and `modeline' are face names,
and can be found listed with all faces in the current mode by using
`M-x set-face-font (enter) ?'.  They use the face-specific resource
`attributeFont'.

   On the other hand, `menubar' is a normal X thing that uses the
resource `font'.  With Motif it _may be_ necessary to use `fontList'
_instead of_ `font'.  In _non-Motif_ configurations with Mule it _is_
necessary to use `fontSet' instead of `font'.  (Sorry, there just is no
simple recipe here.)

     Emacs.zmacs-region.attributeForeground: firebrick
     Emacs.zmacs-region.attributeBackground: lightseagreen

Q3.2.4: How can I limit color map usage?
----------------------------------------

I'm using Netscape (or another color grabber like XEmacs); is there any
way to limit the number of available colors in the color map?

   Answer: No, but you can start Netscape before XEmacs, and it will use
the closest available color if the colormap is full.  You can also limit
the number of colors Netscape uses, using the flags -mono, -ncols <#> or
-install (for mono, limiting to <#> colors, or for using a private color
map).

   If you have the money, another solution would be to use a truecolor
or direct color video.

     and then reload ~/.Xresources and restart XEmacs.  Alternatively,
     since each face can have its own pixmap background, a better way
     would be to set a face's pixmap within your XEmacs init file, e.g.,

            (set-face-background-pixmap 'default "/path/to/image.xpm")

Q3.2.7: How do I display non-ASCII characters?
----------------------------------------------

If you're using a Mule-enabled XEmacs, then display is automatic.  If
you're not seeing the characters you expect, either (1) you don't have
appropriate fonts available or (2) XEmacs did not correctly detect the
coding system (*note Recognize Coding: (xemacs)Recognize Coding.).  In
case (1), install fonts as is customary for your platform.  In case
(2), you need to tell XEmacs explicitly what coding systems you're
using.  *Note Specify Coding: (xemacs)Specify Coding.

   If your XEmacs is not Mule-enabled, and for some reason getting a
Mule-enabled XEmacs seems like the wrong thing to do, all is not lost.
You can arrange it by brute force.  In `event-Xt.c' (suppress the urge
to look in this file--play Doom instead, because you'll survive
longer), it is written:

     In a non-Mule world, a user can still have a multi-lingual editor,
     by doing `(set-face-font "-*-iso8859-2" (current-buffer))' for all
     their Latin-2 buffers, etc.

Q3.3.5: How can one change the modeline color based on the mode used?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use something like the following:

     (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (set-face-background 'modeline "red" (current-buffer))))

   Then, when editing a Lisp file (i.e. when in Lisp mode), the modeline
colors change from the default set in your `init.el'/`.emacs'.  The
change will only be made in the buffer you just entered (which contains
the Lisp file you are editing) and will not affect the modeline colors
anywhere else.

   Notes:

   * The hook is the mode name plus `-hook'.  eg. c-mode-hook,
     c++-mode-hook, emacs-lisp-mode-hook (used for your
     `init.el'/`.emacs' or a `xx.el' file), lisp-interaction-mode-hook
     (the `*scratch*' buffer), text-mode-hook, etc.

   * Be sure to use `add-hook', not `(setq c-mode-hook xxxx)',
     otherwise you will erase anything that anybody has already put on
     the hook.

   * You can also do `(set-face-font 'modeline FONT)', eg.
     `(set-face-font 'modeline "*bold-r-normal*140-100-100*"
     (current-buffer))' if you wish the modeline font to vary based on
     the current mode.

   There are additional modeline faces, `modeline-buffer-id',
`modeline-mousable', and `modeline-mousable-minor-mode', which you may
want to customize.

3.5: The Keyboard
=================

Q3.5.1: How can I bind complex functions (or macros) to keys?
-------------------------------------------------------------

As an example, say you want the `paste' key on a Sun keyboard to insert
the current Primary X selection at point. You can accomplish this with:

     (define-key global-map [f18] 'x-insert-selection)

   However, this only works if there is a current X selection (the
selection will be highlighted).  The functionality I like is for the
`paste' key to insert the current X selection if there is one,
otherwise insert the contents of the clipboard.  To do this you need to
pass arguments to `x-insert-selection'.  This is done by wrapping the
call in a 'lambda form:

     (global-set-key [f18]
       (lambda () (interactive) (x-insert-selection t nil)))

   This binds the f18 key to a "generic" functional object.  The
interactive spec is required because only interactive functions can be
bound to keys.

   For the FAQ example you could use:

     (global-set-key [(control ?.)]
       (lambda () (interactive) (scroll-up 1)))
     (global-set-key [(control ?;)]
       (lambda () (interactive) (scroll-up -1)))

   This is fine if you only need a few functions within the lambda body.
If you're doing more it's cleaner to define a separate function as in
question 3.5.3 (*note Q3.5.3::).

       (scroll-up 1))
     
     (defun scroll-down-one-line ()
       (interactive)
       (scroll-down 1))
     
     (global-set-key [(control ?.)] 'scroll-up-one-line) ; C-.
     (global-set-key [(control ?;)] 'scroll-down-one-line) ; C-;

   The key point is that you can only bind simple functions to keys; you
can not bind a key to a function that you're also passing arguments to.

       "Scroll the selected window down (backward in the text) one line (or N)."
       (interactive "p")
       (scroll-down (or arg 1)))
     
     (global-set-key [up]   'scroll-one-line-up)
     (global-set-key [down] 'scroll-one-line-down)

   The following will also work but will affect more than just the
cursor keys (i.e. `C-n' and `C-p'):

     (setq scroll-step 1)

----------------------------------------------------------

The following works in GNU Emacs 19:

   The following works in XEmacs with the addition of shift:

     (global-set-key [(shift help)] 'help-command);; Help

   But it doesn't work alone.  This is in the file `PROBLEMS' which
should have come with your XEmacs installation: _Emacs ignores the
`help' key when running OLWM_.

   OLWM grabs the `help' key, and retransmits it to the appropriate
client using `XSendEvent'.  Allowing Emacs to react to synthetic events
is a security hole, so this is turned off by default.  You can enable
it by setting the variable `x-allow-sendevents' to t.  You can also
cause fix this by telling OLWM to not grab the help key, with the null
binding `OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Help:'.

     It depends upon your X server.

     Generally, the simplest way is to define a key as Multi_key with
     xmodmap, e.g.
                  xmodmap -e 'keycode 0xff20 = Multi_key'

     You will need to pick an appropriate keycode. Use xev to find out
     the keycodes for each key.

     [NB: On a `Windows' keyboard, recent versions of XFree86
     automatically define the right `Windows' key as Multi_key'.]

     Once you have Multi_key defined, you can use e.g.
                  Multi a '       => á
                  Multi e "       => ë
                  Multi c ,       => ç

     etc.

     Also, recent versions of XFree86 define various AltGr-<key>
     combinations as dead keys, i.e.
                  AltGr [         => dead_diaeresis
                  AltGr ]         => dead_tilde
                  AltGr ;         => dead_acute
     etc.

     Running `xmodmap -pk' will list all of the defined keysyms.

3.6: The Cursor
===============

Q3.6.1: Is there a way to make the bar cursor thicker?
------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to have the bar cursor a little thicker, as I tend to "lose" it
often.

   For a 1 pixel bar cursor, use:

     (setq bar-cursor t)

   For a 2 pixel bar cursor, use:

     (setq bar-cursor 'anything-else)

   Starting with XEmacs-20.3 you can also change these with Customize.
Select from the `Options' menu `Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Environment->Display->Bar Cursor...' or type `M-x
customize <RET> display <RET>'.

   You can use a color to make it stand out better:

     Emacs*cursorColor:      Red

----------------------------------------------------

     (setq bar-cursor nil)

   Starting with XEmacs 20.3 you can also change this with Customize.

Q3.6.3: Can I make the cursor blink?
------------------------------------

Yes, like this:

     (blink-cursor-mode)

   This function toggles between a steady cursor and a blinking cursor.
You may also set this mode from the menu bar by selecting `Options =>
Frame Appearance => Blinking Cursor'.  Remember to save options.

3.7: The Mouse and Highlighting
===============================

Q3.7.1: How can I turn off Mouse pasting?
-----------------------------------------

I keep hitting the middle mouse button by accident and getting stuff
pasted into my buffer so how can I turn this off?

   Here is an alternative binding, whereby the middle mouse button
selects (but does not cut) the expression under the mouse. Clicking
middle on a left or right paren will select to the matching one.  Note
that you can use `define-key' or `global-set-key'.

     (defun mouse-set-point-and-select (event)
       "Sets the point at the mouse location, then marks following form"
       (interactive "@e")
       (mouse-set-point event)
       (mark-sexp 1))
     (define-key global-map [button2] 'mouse-set-point-and-select)

Q3.7.2: How do I set control/meta/etc modifiers on mouse buttons?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Use, for instance, `[(meta button1)]'. For example, here is a common
setting for Common Lisp programmers who use the bundled `ilisp'
package, whereby meta-button1 on a function name will find the file
where the function name was defined, and put you at that location in
the source file.

   [Inside a function that gets called by the lisp-mode-hook and
ilisp-mode-hook]

     (local-set-key [(meta button1)] 'edit-definitions-lisp)

Q3.7.3: Clicking the left button does not do anything in buffer list.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I do `C-x C-b' to get a list of buffers and the entries get highlighted
when I move the mouse over them but clicking the left mouse does not do
anything.

   Use the middle mouse button.

Q3.7.5: Why does cut-and-paste not work between XEmacs and a cmdtool?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We don't know.  It's a bug.  There does seem to be a work-around,
however.  Try running xclipboard first.  It appears to fix the problem
even if you exit it.  (This should be mostly fixed in 19.13, but we
haven't yet verified that).

Q3.7.6: How I can set XEmacs up so that it pastes where the text cursor is?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default XEmacs pastes X selections where the mouse pointer is.  How
do I disable this?

   Examine the function `mouse-yank', by typing `C-h f mouse-yank
<RET>'.

   To get XEmacs to paste at the text cursor, add this your
`init.el'/`.emacs':

     (setq mouse-yank-at-point t)

   Starting with XEmacs-20.2 you can also change this with Customize.
Select from the `Options' menu `Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Mouse->Yank At Point...' or type `M-x
customize <RET> mouse <RET>'.

Q3.7.7: How do I select a rectangular region?
---------------------------------------------

Just select the region normally, then use the rectangle commands (e.g.
`kill-rectangle' on it.  The region does not highlight as a rectangle,
but the commands work just fine.

   To actually sweep out rectangular regions with the mouse you can use
`mouse-track-do-rectangle' which is assigned to `M-button1'.  Then use
rectangle commands.

   You can also do the following to change default behavior to sweep out
rectangular regions:

     (setq mouse-track-rectangle-p t)

   Starting with XEmacs-20.2 you can also change this with Customize.
Select from the `Options' menu `Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Mouse->Track Rectangle...' or type `M-x
customize <RET> mouse <RET>'.

      mouse-track-do-rectangle: (event)
        -- an interactive compiled Lisp function.
      Like `mouse-track' but selects rectangles instead of regions.

Q3.7.8: Why does `M-w' take so long?
------------------------------------

It actually doesn't.  It leaves the region visible for a second so that
you can see what area is being yanked.  If you start working, though, it
will immediately complete its operation.  In other words, it will only
delay for a second if you let it.

Q3.8.2: Can I customize the basic menubar?
------------------------------------------

For an extensive menubar, add this line to your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (load "big-menubar")

   If you'd like to write your own, this file provides as good a set of
examples as any to start from.  The file is located in edit-utils

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the following to your `init.el'/`.emacs' (suit to fit):

     (setq buffers-menu-max-size 20)

   For no limit, use an argument of `nil'.

   Starting with XEmacs-20.3 you can also change this with Customize.
Select from the `Options' menu `Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Environment->Menu->Buffers Menu->Max Size...' or
type `M-x customize <RET> buffers-menu <RET>'.

Q3.8.4: Resources like `Emacs*menubar*font' are not working?
------------------------------------------------------------

I am trying to use a resource like `Emacs*menubar*font' to set the font
of the menubar but it's not working.

   In Motif, the use of `font' resources is obsoleted in order to
support internationalization.  If you are using the real Motif menubar,
this resource is not recognized at all; you have to say:

     Emacs*menubar*fontList: FONT

   If you are using the Lucid menubar, for backward compatibility with
existing user configurations, the `font' resource is recognized.  Since
this is not supported by Motif itself, the code is a kludge and the
`font' resource will be recognized only if the `fontList' resource
resource is unset.  This means that the resource

     *fontList: FONT

   will override

     Emacs*menubar*font: FONT

   even though the latter is more specific.

   In non-Motif configurations using `--with-mule' and `--with-xfs' it
_is_ necessary to use the `fontSet' resource _instead of_ the `font'
resource.  The backward compatibility kludge was never implemented for
non-Motif builds.  Example:

     *fontSet: FONT

Q3.8.5: How can I bind a key to a function to toggle the toolbar?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Try something like:

     (defun my-toggle-toolbar ()
       (interactive)
       (set-specifier default-toolbar-visible-p
                      (not (specifier-instance default-toolbar-visible-p))))
     (global-set-key "\C-xT" 'my-toggle-toolbar)

   There are redisplay bugs in 19.14 that may make the preceding result
in a messed-up display, especially for frames with multiple windows.
You may need to resize the frame before XEmacs completely realizes the
toolbar is really gone.

   Thanks to Martin Buchholz <martin@xemacs.org> for the correct code.

3.9: Scrollbars
===============

Q3.9.1: How can I disable the scrollbar?
----------------------------------------

To disable them for all frames, add the following line to your
`.Xresources':

     Emacs.scrollBarWidth:  0

   Or select from the `Options' menu `Frame Appearance->Scrollbars'.
Remember to save options.

   To turn the scrollbar off on a per-frame basis, use the following
function:

     (set-specifier scrollbar-width 0 (selected-frame))

   You can actually turn the scrollbars on at any level you want by
substituting for (selected-frame) in the above command.  For example, to
turn the scrollbars off only in a single buffer:

     (set-specifier scrollbar-width 0 (current-buffer))

Q3.9.2: How can one use resources to change scrollbar colors?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a recap of how to use resources to change your scrollbar colors:

     ! Motif scrollbars
     
     Emacs*XmScrollBar.Background: skyblue
     Emacs*XmScrollBar.troughColor: lightgray
     
     ! Athena scrollbars
     
     Emacs*Scrollbar.Foreground: skyblue
     Emacs*Scrollbar.Background: lightgray

Q3.9.3: Moving the scrollbar can move the point; can I disable this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When I move the scrollbar in an XEmacs window, it moves the point as
well, which should not be the default behavior.  Is this a bug or a
feature?  Can I disable it?

   The current behavior is a feature, not a bug.  Point remains at the
same buffer position as long as that position does not scroll off the
screen.  In that event, point will end up in either the upper-left or
lower-left hand corner.

   This cannot be changed.

Q3.9.4: How can I turn off automatic horizontal scrolling in specific modes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do `(setq truncate-lines t)' in the mode-hooks for any modes in which
you want lines truncated.

   More precisely: If `truncate-lines' is nil, horizontal scrollbars
will never appear.  Otherwise, they will appear only if the value of
`scrollbar-height' for that buffer/window/etc. is non-zero.  If you do

     (set-specifier scrollbar-height 0)

   then horizontal scrollbars will not appear in truncated buffers
unless the package specifically asked for them.

3.10: Text Selections
=====================

Q3.10.1: How can I turn off or change highlighted selections?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The `zmacs' mode allows for what some might call gratuitous
highlighting for selected regions (either by setting mark or by using
the mouse).  This is the default behavior.  To turn off, add the
following line to your `init.el'/`.emacs' file:

     (setq zmacs-regions nil)

   Starting with XEmacs-20.2 you can also change this with Customize.
Select from the `Options' menu `Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Basics->Zmacs Regions' or type `M-x
customize <RET> editing-basics <RET>'.

   To change the face for selection, look at `Options->Customize' on
the menubar.

Q3.10.2: How do I get that typing on an active region removes it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I want to change things so that if I select some text and start typing,
the typed text replaces the selected text, similar to Motif.

   You want to use something called "pending delete".  Pending delete
is what happens when you select a region (with the mouse or keyboard)
and you press a key to replace the selected region by the key you typed.
Usually backspace kills the selected region.

   To get this behavior, add the following lines to your
`init.el'/`.emacs':

     (cond
      ((fboundp 'turn-on-pending-delete)
       (turn-on-pending-delete))
      ((fboundp 'pending-delete-on)
       (pending-delete-on t)))

   Note that this will work with both Backspace and Delete.  This code
is a tad more complicated than it has to be for XEmacs in order to make
it more portable.

Q3.10.3: Can I turn off the highlight during isearch?
-----------------------------------------------------

I do not like my text highlighted while I am doing isearch as I am not
able to see what's underneath.  How do I turn it off?

   Put the following in your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (setq isearch-highlight nil)

   Starting with XEmacs-20.2 you can also change this with Customize.
Type `M-x customize-variable <RET> isearch-highlight <RET>'.

   Note also that isearch-highlight affects query-replace and ispell.
Instead of disabling isearch-highlight you may find that a better
solution consists of customizing the `isearch' face.

Q3.10.5: The region disappears when I hit the end of buffer while scrolling.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This has been fixed by default starting with XEmacs-20.3.

   With older versions you can turn this feature (if it indeed is a
feature) off like this:

     (defadvice scroll-up (around scroll-up freeze)
       (interactive "_P")
       (let ((zmacs-region-stays t))
         (if (interactive-p)
             (condition-case nil
                 ad-do-it
               (end-of-buffer (goto-char (point-max))))
           ad-do-it)))
     
     (defadvice scroll-down (around scroll-down freeze)
       (interactive "_P")
       (let ((zmacs-region-stays t))
         (if (interactive-p)
             (condition-case nil
                 ad-do-it
               (beginning-of-buffer (goto-char (point-min))))
           ad-do-it)))

Q3.10.6: Why is killing so slow?
--------------------------------

This actually is an X Windows question, although you'll notice it with
keyboard operations as well as while using the GUI.  Basically, there
are four ways to communicate interprogram via the X server:

*Primary selection*
     a transient selection that gets replaced every time a new
     selection is made

*Secondary selection*
     for "exchanging" with the primary selection

*Cut buffers*
     a clipboard internal to the X server (deprecated)

*Clipboard selection*
     a selection with a notification protocol that allows a separate
     app to manage the clipboard

   The cut buffers are deprecated because managing them is even more
inefficient than the clipboard notification protocol.  The primary
selection works fine for many users and applications, but is not very
robust under intensive or sophisticated use.

   In Motif and MS Windows, a clipboard has become the primary means for
managing cut and paste.  These means that "modern" applications tend to
be oriented toward a true clipboard, rather than the primary selection.
(On Windows, there is nothing equivalent to the primary selection.)
It's not that XEmacs doesn't support the simple primary selection
method, it's that more and more other applications don't.

   So the slowdown occurs because XEmacs now engages in the clipboard
notification protocol on _every_ kill.  This is especially slow on
Motif.

   With most people running most clients and server on the same host,
and many of the rest working over very fast communication, you may
expect that the situation is not going to improve.

   There are a number of workarounds.  The most effective is to use a
special command to do selection ownership only when you intend to paste
to another application.  Useful commands are `kill-primary-selection'
and `copy-primary-selection'.  These work only on text selected with
the mouse (probably; experiment), and are bound by default to the `Cut'
and `Copy', respectively, buttons on the toolbar.
`copy-primary-selection' is also bound to `C-Insert'.  You can yank the
clipboard contents with `yank-primary-selection', bound to the `Paste'
toolbar button and `Sh-Insert'.

   If you are communicating by cut and paste with applications that use
the primary selection, then you can customize
`interprogram-cut-function' to `nil', restoring the XEmacs version 20
behavior.  How can you tell if a program will support this?
Motifly-correct programs require the clipboard; you lose.  For others,
only by trying it.  You also need to customize the complementary
`interprogram-paste-function' to `nil'.  (Otherwise XEmacs-to-XEmacs
pastes will not work correctly.)

   You may get some relief on Motif by setting
`x-selection-strict-motif-ownership' to nil, but this means you will
only intermittently be able to paste XEmacs kills to Motif applications.

   Thanks to Jeff Mincy and Glynn Clements for corrections.

My mailbox lives at the office on a big honkin server.  My regular INBOX
lives on my honkin desktop machine.  I now can PPP to the office from
home which is far from honking...  I'd like to be able to read mail at
home without storing it here and I'd like to use xemacs and VM at
home...  Is there a recommended setup?

     There are several ways to do this.

       1. Set your display to your home machine and run dxpc or one of
          the other X compressors.

       2. NFS mount your desktop machine on your home machine and
          modify your pop command on your home machine to rsh to your
          desktop machine and actually do the pop get's.

       3. Run a POP server on your desktop machine as well and do a
          sort of two tiered POP get.

     Or you could run a pop script periodically on your desktop

Q4.0.9: rmail or VM gets an error incorporating new mail.
---------------------------------------------------------

Quoting the XEmacs PROBLEMS file:

     rmail and VM get new mail from `/usr/spool/mail/$USER' using a
     program called `movemail'.  This program interlocks with
     `/bin/mail' using the protocol defined by `/bin/mail'.

     There are two different protocols in general use.  One of them
     uses the `flock' system call.  The other involves creating a lock
     file; `movemail' must be able to write in `/usr/spool/mail' in
     order to do this.  You control which one is used by defining, or
     not defining, the macro `MAIL_USE_FLOCK' in `config.h' or the m-
     or s- file it includes.

     *IF YOU DON'T USE THE FORM OF INTERLOCKING THAT IS NORMAL ON YOUR
     SYSTEM, YOU CAN LOSE MAIL!*

     If your system uses the lock file protocol, and fascist
     restrictions prevent ordinary users from writing the lock files in
     `/usr/spool/mail', you may need to make `movemail' setgid to a
     suitable group such as `mail'.  You can use these commands (as
     root):

          chgrp mail movemail
          chmod 2755 movemail

     If your system uses the lock file protocol, and fascist
     restrictions prevent ordinary users from writing the lock files in
     `/usr/spool/mail', you may need to make `movemail' setgid to a
     suitable group such as `mail'.  To do this, use the following
     commands (as root) after doing the make install.

          chgrp mail movemail
          chmod 2755 movemail

     Installation normally copies movemail from the build directory to
     an installation directory which is usually under `/usr/local/lib'.
     The installed copy of `movemail' is usually in the directory
     `/usr/local/lib/emacs/VERSION/TARGET'.  You must change the group
     and mode of the installed copy; changing the group and mode of the
     build directory copy is ineffective.

Q4.0.12: Customization of VM not covered in the manual, or here.
----------------------------------------------------------------

giacomo boffi <boffi@hp735.stru.polimi.it> writes:

     The meta-answer is to look into the file `vm-vars.el', in the vm
     directory of the lisp library.

     `vm-vars.el' contains, initializes and carefully describes, with
     examples of usage, the plethora of user options that _fully_
     control VM's behavior.

     Enter vm-vars, `forward-search' for toolbar, find the variables
     that control the toolbar placement, appearance, existence, copy to
     your `init.el'/`.emacs' or `.vm' and modify according to the
     detailed instructions.

     The above also applies to all the various features of VM: search
     for some keywords, maybe the first you conjure isn't appropriate,
     find the appropriate variables, copy and experiment.

Q4.3.2: What is TM and where do I get it?
-----------------------------------------

TM stands for "Tools for MIME" and not Tiny MIME.  TM integrates with
all major XEmacs packages like Gnus (all flavors), VM, MH-E, and
mailcrypt.  It provides totally transparent and trouble-free MIME
support.  When appropriate a message will be decoded in place in an
XEmacs buffer.

   TM now comes as a package with XEmacs 19.16 and XEmacs 20.2.

   TM was written by MORIOKA Tomohiko <morioka@jaist.ac.jp> and
KOBAYASHI Shuhei <shuhei-k@jaist.ac.jp>.

   It is based on the work of UMEDA Masanobu
<umerin@mse.kyutech.ac.jp>, the original writer of GNUS.

   The following information is from the `README':

   "tm" is a MIME package for GNU Emacs.  tm has following functions:

   * MIME style multilingual header.

   * MIME message viewer (mime/viewer-mode).

   * MIME message composer (mime/editor-mode).

   * MIME extenders for mh-e, GNUS, RMAIL and VM.

   tm is available from following anonymous ftp sites:
   * `ftp://ftp.unicamp.br/pub/mail/mime/tm/' (Brasil).

   * `ftp://ftp.th-darmstadt.de/pub/editors/GNU-Emacs/lisp/mime/'
     (Germany).

   * `ftp://ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de/pub/editors/xemacs/contrib/'
     (Germany).

   Don't let the installation procedure & instructions stop you from
trying this package out--it's much simpler than it looks, and once
installed, trivial to use.

   Steve Youngs <youngs@xemacs.org> writes:

     All the major Emacs Lisp based MUAs (Gnus, MH-E, and VM) all do
     their own thing when it comes to MIME so you won't need TM to get
     MIME support in these packages.

   EOS stands for "Era on SPARCworks", but I don't know what Era stands

   EOS is the integration of XEmacs with the SPARCworks debugger.  It
allows one to use an XEmacs frame to view code (complete with
fontification, etc.), set breakpoints, print variables, etc., while
using the SPARCworks debugger.  It works very well and I use it all the

4.6: Infodock
=============

Q4.6.1: What is Infodock?
-------------------------

InfoDock (http://sourceforge.net/projects/infodock/) is an integrated
productivity toolset, mainly aimed at technical people, hosted at
SourceForge.

   InfoDock is built atop the XEmacs variant of GNU Emacs and so has
all of the power of Emacs, but with an easier to use and more
comprehensive menu-based user interface.  The bottom portion of this
text describes how it differs from XEmacs and GNU Emacs from the Free
Software Foundation.

   InfoDock is aimed at people who want a free, turn-key productivity
environment.  Although InfoDock is customizable, it is not intended for
people who like basic versions of Emacs which need to be customized
extensively for local use; standard Emacs distributions are better for
such uses.  InfoDock is for those people who want a complete,
pre-customized environment in one package, which they need not touch
more than once or twice a year to update to new revisions.

   InfoDock is pre-built for SPARC SunOS/Solaris systems, PA-RISC HP-UX,
and Intel Linux systems.  It is intended for use on a color display,
although most features will work on monochrome monitors.  Simply unpack
InfoDock according to the instructions in the ID-INSTALL file and you
are ready to run.

   The InfoDock Manual is concise, yet sufficient as a user guide for
users who have never used an Emacs-type editor before.  For users who
are already familiar with Emacs, it supplements the information in the
GNU Emacs Manual.

   InfoDock menus are much more extensive and more mature than standard
Emacs menus.  Each menu offers a `Manual' item which displays
documentation associated with the menu's functions.

Four types of menubars are provided:
  1. An extensive menubar providing access to global InfoDock commands.

  2. Mode-specific menubars tailored to the current major mode.

  3. A simple menubar for basic editing to help novices get started
     with InfoDock.

  4. The standard XEmacs menubar.

   Most modes also include mode-specific popup menus.  Additionally,
region and rectangle popup menus are included.

   `Hyperbole', the everyday information manager, is a core part of
InfoDock.  This provides context-sensitive mouse keys, a rolodex-type
contact manager, programmable hypertext buttons, and an autonumbered
outliner with embedded hyperlink anchors.

   The `OO-Browser', a multi-language object-oriented code browser, is a
standard part of InfoDock.

   InfoDock saves a more extensive set of user options than other Emacs
versions.

   InfoDock inserts a useful file header in many file types, showing the
author, summary, and last modification time of each file.  A summary
program can then be used to summarize all of the files in a directory,
for easy MANIFEST file creation.

   Your working set of buffers is automatically saved and restored (if
you answer yes to a prompt) between InfoDock sessions.

   Refined color choices for code highlighting are provided for both
dark and light background display frames.

   The `C-z' key prefix performs frame-based commands which parallel the
`C-x' key prefix for window-based commands.

   The Smart Menu system is included for producing command menus on dumb
terminals.

   Lisp libraries are better categorized according to function.

   Extensions and improvements to many areas of Emacs are included,
such as: paragraph filling, mail reading with Rmail, shell handling,
outlining, code highlighting and browsing, and man page browsing.

   InfoDock questions, answers and discussion should go to the mail list
<infodock@infodock.com>.  Use <infodock-request@infodock.com> to be
added or removed from the list.  Always include your InfoDock version
number when sending help requests.

   InfoDock is available across the Internet via anonymous FTP.  To get
it, first move to a directory into which you want the InfoDock archive
files placed.  We will call this <DIST-DIR>.

        cd <DIST-DIR>

   Ftp to ftp.xemacs.org  (Internet Host ID = 128.174.252.16):

        prompt> ftp ftp.xemacs.org

   Login as `anonymous' with your own <user-id>@<site-name> as a
password.

        Name (ftp.xemacs.org): anonymous
        331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
        Password: -<your-user-id>@<your-domain>
        230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.

   Move to the location of the InfoDock archives:

        ftp> cd pub/infodock

   Set your transfer mode to binary:

        ftp> bin
        200 Type set to I.

   Turn off prompting:

        ftp> prompt
        Interactive mode off.

   Retrieve the InfoDock archives that you want, either by using a `get
<file>' for each file you want or by using the following to get a
complete distribution, including all binaries:

        ftp> mget ID-INSTALL
        ftp> mget id-*

   Close the FTP connection:

        ftp> quit
        221 Goodbye.

4.7: Other Unbundled Packages
=============================

Q4.7.1: What is AUC TeX?  Where do you get it?
----------------------------------------------

AUC TeX is a package written by Per Abrahamsen <abraham@dina.kvl.dk>.
Starting with XEmacs 19.16, AUC TeX is bundled with XEmacs.  The
following information is from the `README' and website.

   AUC TeX is an extensible package that supports writing and formatting
TeX files for most variants of GNU Emacs. Many different macro packages
are supported, including AMS TeX, LaTeX, and TeXinfo.

   The most recent version is always available by ftp at
`ftp://sunsite.dk/packages/auctex/auctex.tar.gz'.

   In case you don't have access to anonymous ftp, you can get it by an
email request to <ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com>.

   WWW users may want to check out the AUC TeX page at
`http://sunsite.dk/auctex/'.

Q4.7.4: Problems installing AUC TeX.
------------------------------------

Jan Vroonhof <vroonhof@math.ethz.ch> writes:

     AUC TeX works fine on both stock Emacs and XEmacs has been doing
     so for a very very long time. This is mostly due to the work of
     Per Abrahamsen <abraham@dina.kvl.dk> (clap clap) in particular his
     `easymenu' package.  Which leads to what is probably the problem...

   Most problems with AUC TeX are one of two things:

   * The TeX-lisp-directory in `tex-site.el' and the makefile don't
     match.

     Fix: make sure you configure AUC TeX properly *before* installing.

   * You have an old version of easymenu.el in your path.

     Fix: use `locate-library' and remove old versions to make sure it
     *only* finds the one that came with XEmacs.

Q4.7.5: Is there a reason for an Emacs package not to be included in XEmacs?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason for an Emacs package not to be included in XEmacs is usually
one or more of the following:

  1. The package has not been ported to XEmacs.  This will typically
     happen when it uses GNU-Emacs-specific features, which make it
     fail under XEmacs.

     Porting a package to XEmacs can range from a trivial amount of
     change to a partial or full rewrite.  Fortunately, the authors of
     modern packages usually choose to support both Emacsen themselves.

  2. The package has been decided not to be appropriate for XEmacs.  It
     may have an equivalent or better replacement within XEmacs, in
     which case the developers may choose not to burden themselves with
     supporting an additional package.

     Each package bundled with XEmacs means more work for the
     maintainers, whether they want it or not.  If you are ready to
     take over the maintenance responsibilities for the package you
     port, be sure to say so--we will more likely include it.

  3. The package simply hasn't been noted by the XEmacs development.  If
     that's the case, the messages like yours are very useful for
     attracting our attention.

  4. The package was noted by the developers, but they simply haven't
     yet gotten around to including/porting it.  Wait for the next
     release or, even better, offer your help.  It will be gladly
     accepted and appreciated.

Q4.7.7: Can I edit files on other hosts?
----------------------------------------

Yes.  Of course XEmacs can use any network file system (such as NFS or
Windows file sharing) you have available, and includes some
optimizations and safety features appropriate to those environments.

   It is also possible to transparently edit files via FTP, ssh, or
rsh.  That is, XEmacs makes a local copy using the transport in the
background, and automatically refreshes the remote original from that
copy when you save it.  XEmacs also is capable of doing file system
manipulations like creating and removing directories and files.  The
FTP interface is provided by the standard `efs' package *Note EFS:
(efs)Top.  The ssh/rsh interface is provided by the optional `tramp'
package *Note TRAMP: (tramp)Top.

5.0: Major & Minor Modes
========================

Q5.0.1: How can I do source code highlighting using font-lock?
--------------------------------------------------------------

For most modes, font-lock is already set up and just needs to be turned
on.  This can be done by adding the line:

     (require 'font-lock)

   to your `init.el'/`.emacs'. (You can turn it on for the current
buffer and session only by `M-x font-lock-mode'.) See the file
`etc/sample.init.el' (`etc/sample.emacs' in XEmacs versions prior to
21.4) for more information.

   See also `Syntax Highlighting' from the `Options' menu.  Remember to
save options.

Q5.0.2: I do not like cc-mode.  How do I use the old c-mode?
------------------------------------------------------------

Well, first off, consider if you really want to do this.  cc-mode is
much more powerful than the old c-mode.  If you're having trouble
getting your old offsets to work, try using `c-set-offset' instead.
You might also consider using the package `cc-compat'.

   But, if you still insist, add the following lines to your
`init.el'/`.emacs':

     (fmakunbound 'c-mode)
     (makunbound 'c-mode-map)
     (fmakunbound 'c++-mode)
     (makunbound 'c++-mode-map)
     (makunbound 'c-style-alist)
     (load-library "old-c-mode")
     (load-library "old-c++-mode")

   This must be done before any other reference is made to either
c-mode or c++-mode.

Q5.0.3: How do I get `More' Syntax Highlighting on by default?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following code in your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (setq-default font-lock-maximum-decoration t)

   See also `Syntax Highlighting' from the `Options' menu.  Remember to
save options.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q5.0.4,  Next: Q5.0.5,  Prev: Q5.0.3,  Up: Miscellaneous

Q5.0.4: How can I enable auto-indent and/or Filladapt?
------------------------------------------------------

Put the following line in your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (setq indent-line-function 'indent-relative-maybe)

   If you want to get fancy, try the `filladapt' package available
standard with XEmacs.  Put this into your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (require 'filladapt)
     (setq-default filladapt-mode t)
     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)

   This will enable Filladapt for all modes except C mode, where it
doesn't work well.  To turn Filladapt on only in particular major
modes, remove the `(setq-default ...)' line and use
`turn-on-filladapt-mode', like this:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-filladapt-mode)

   You can customize filling and adaptive filling with Customize.
Select from the `Options' menu `Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Editing->Fill->Fill...' or type `M-x customize
<RET> fill <RET>'.

   Note that well-behaving text-lookalike modes will run
`text-mode-hook' by default (e.g. that's what Message does).  For the
nasty ones, you'll have to provide the `add-hook's yourself.

   Please note that the `fa-extras' package is no longer useful.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q5.0.5,  Next: Q5.0.6,  Prev: Q5.0.4,  Up: Miscellaneous

Q5.0.5: How can I get XEmacs to come up in text/auto-fill mode by default?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try the following lisp in your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)
     (setq text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

   *WARNING*: note that changing the value of `default-major-mode' from
`fundamental-mode' can break a large amount of built-in code that
expects newly created buffers to be in `fundamental-mode'.  (Changing
from `fundamental-mode' to `text-mode' might not wreak too much havoc,
but changing to something more exotic like a lisp-mode would break many
Emacs packages).

   Note that Emacs by default starts up in buffer `*scratch*' in
`initial-major-mode', which defaults to `lisp-interaction-mode'. Thus
adding the following form to your Emacs init file will cause the
initial `*scratch*' buffer to be put into auto-fill'ed `text-mode':

     (setq initial-major-mode
           (lambda ()
             (text-mode)
             (turn-on-auto-fill)))

   Note that after your init file is loaded, if
`inhibit-startup-message' is `nil' (the default) and the startup buffer
is `*scratch*' then the startup message will be inserted into
`*scratch*'; it will be removed after a timeout by erasing the entire
`*scratch*' buffer.  Keep in mind this default usage of `*scratch*' if
you desire any prior manipulation of `*scratch*' from within your Emacs
init file. In particular, anything you insert into `*scratch*' from
your init file will be later erased. Also, if you change the mode of
the `*scratch*' buffer, be sure that this will not interfere with
possible later insertion of the startup message (e.g. if you put
`*scratch*' into a nonstandard mode that has automatic font lock rules,
then the startup message might get fontified in a strange foreign
manner, e.g. as code in some programming language).

Q5.0.6: How do I start up a second shell buffer?
------------------------------------------------

In the `*shell*' buffer:

     M-x rename-buffer <RET> *shell-1* <RET>
     M-x shell RET

   This will then start a second shell.  The key is that no buffer named
`*shell*' can exist.  It might be preferable to use `M-x
rename-uniquely' to rename the `*shell*' buffer instead of `M-x
rename-buffer'.

   Alternately, you can set the variable `shell-multiple-shells'.  If
the value of this variable is non-nil, each time shell mode is invoked,
a new shell is made

Q5.0.7: Telnet from shell filters too much
------------------------------------------

I'm using the Emacs `M-x shell' function, and I would like to invoke
and use a telnet session within it.  Everything works fine except that
now all `^M''s are filtered out by Emacs.  Fixes?

   Use `M-x rsh' or `M-x telnet' to open remote sessions rather than
doing rsh or telnet within the local shell buffer.  Starting with
XEmacs-20.3 you can also use `M-x ssh' to open secure remote session if
you have `ssh' installed.

Q5.0.8: Why does edt emulation not work?
----------------------------------------

We don't know, but you can use tpu-edt emulation instead, which works
fine and is a little fancier than the standard edt emulation.  To do
this, add the following line to your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (tpu-edt)

   If you don't want it to replace `C-h' with an edt-style help menu
add this as well:

     (global-set-key [(control h)] 'help-for-help)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Our recommended VI emulator is viper. To make viper-mode the default,
add this to your `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (viper-mode)

   Michael Kifer <kifer@CS.SunySB.EDU> writes:

     This should be added as close to the top of `init.el'/`.emacs' as
     you can get it, otherwise some minor modes may not get viper-ized.

Q5.0.12: How do I disable gnuserv from opening a new frame?
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you set the `gnuserv-frame' variable to the frame that should be
used to display buffers that are pulled up, a new frame will not be
created. For example, you could put

     (setq gnuserv-frame (selected-frame))

   early on in your `init.el'/`.emacs', to ensure that the first frame
created is the one used for your gnuserv buffers.

   There is an option to set the gnuserv target to the current frame.
See `Options->Display->"Other Window" Location->Make Current Frame
Gnuserv Target'

   Starting with XEmacs-20.3 you can also change this with Customize.
Select from the `Options' menu `Advanced
(Customize)->Emacs->Environment->Gnuserv->Gnuserv Frame...' or type
`M-x customize <RET> gnuserv <RET>'.

Q5.0.13: How do I start gnuserv so that each subsequent XEmacs is a client?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put the following in your `init.el'/`.emacs' file to start the server:

     (gnuserv-start)

   Start your first XEmacs as usual.  After that, you can do:

     gnuclient randomfilename

   from the command line to get your existing XEmacs process to open a
new frame and visit randomfilename in that window. When you're done
editing randomfilename, hit `C-x #' to kill the buffer and get rid of
the frame.

   See also man page of gnuclient.

Sometimes (i.e. it's not repeatable, and I can't work out why it

portion of the command is given to the shell, and a blank prompt is
returned.  If I hit return again, the rest of the previous command is
given to the shell.

5.1: Emacs Lisp Programming Techniques
======================================

Q5.1.1: What is the difference in key sequences between XEmacs and GNU Emacs?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Erik Naggum <clerik@naggum.no> writes;

     Emacs has a legacy of keyboards that produced characters with
     modifier bits, and therefore map a variety of input systems into
     this scheme even today.  XEmacs is instead optimized for X events.
     This causes an incompatibility in the way key sequences are
     specified, but both Emacs and XEmacs will accept a key sequence as
     a vector of lists of modifiers that ends with a key, e.g., to bind
     `M-C-a', you would say `[(meta control a)]' in both Emacsen.
     XEmacs has an abbreviated form for a single key, just (meta
     control a).  Emacs has an abbreviated form for the Control and the
     Meta modifiers to string-characters (the ASCII characters), as in
     `\M-\C-a'.  XEmacs users need to be aware that the abbreviated
     form works only for one-character key sequences, while Emacs users
     need to be aware that the string-character is rather limited.
     Specifically, the string-character can accommodate only 256
     different values, 128 of which have the Meta modifier and 128 of
     which have not.  In each of these blocks, only 32 characters have
     the Control modifier.  Whereas `[(meta control A)]' differs from
     `[(meta control a)]' because the case differs, `\M-\C-a' and
     `\M-\C-A' do not.  Programmers are advised to use the full common
     form, both because it is more readable and less error-prone, and
     because it is supported by both Emacsen.

   Another (even safer) way to be sure of the key-sequences is to use
the `read-kbd-macro' function, which takes a string like `C-c <up>',
and converts it to the internal key representation of the Emacs you
use.  The function is available both on XEmacs and GNU Emacs.

Q5.1.2: Can I generate "fake" keyboard events?
----------------------------------------------

I wonder if there is an interactive function that can generate "fake"
keyboard events.  This way, I could simply map them inside XEmacs.

   This seems to work:

     (defun cg--generate-char-event (ch)
       "Generate an event, as if ch has been typed"
       (dispatch-event (character-to-event ch)))
     
     ;;  Backspace and Delete stuff
     (global-set-key [backspace]
       (lambda () (interactive) (cg--generate-char-event 127)))
     (global-set-key [unknown_keysym_0x4]
       (lambda () (interactive) (cg--generate-char-event 4)))

Q5.1.3: Could you explain `read-kbd-macro' in more detail?
----------------------------------------------------------

The `read-kbd-macro' function returns the internal Emacs representation
of a human-readable string (which is its argument).  Thus:

     (read-kbd-macro "C-c C-a")
     => [(control ?c) (control ?a)]
     
     (read-kbd-macro "C-c C-. <up>")
     => [(control ?c) (control ?.) up]

   In GNU Emacs the same forms will be evaluated to what GNU Emacs
understands internally--the sequences `"\C-x\C-c"' and `[3 67108910
up]', respectively.

   The exact "human-readable" syntax is defined in the docstring of
`edmacro-mode'.  I'll repeat it here, for completeness.

     Format of keyboard macros during editing:

     Text is divided into "words" separated by whitespace.  Except for
     the words described below, the characters of each word go directly
     as characters of the macro.  The whitespace that separates words is
     ignored.  Whitespace in the macro must be written explicitly, as in
     `foo <SPC> bar <RET>'.

        * The special words `RET', `SPC', `TAB', `DEL', `LFD', `ESC',
          and `NUL' represent special control characters.  The words
          must be written in uppercase.

        * A word in angle brackets, e.g., `<return>', `<down>', or
          `<f1>', represents a function key.  (Note that in the standard
          configuration, the function key `<return>' and the control key
          <RET> are synonymous.)  You can use angle brackets on the
          words <RET>, <SPC>, etc., but they are not required there.

        * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash
          followed by up to six octal digits.  This is the only way to
          represent keys with codes above \377.

        * One or more prefixes `M-' (meta), `C-' (control), `S-'
          (shift), `A-' (alt), `H-' (hyper), and `s-' (super) may
          precede a character or key notation.  For function keys, the
          prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets: `C-<down>'
          == `<C-down>'.  The prefixes may be written in any order:
          `M-C-x' == `C-M-x'.

          Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., `C-abc',
          except that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of
          digits and optional minus sign: `M--123' == `M-- M-1 M-2 M-3'.

        * The `^' notation for control characters also works: `^M' ==
          `C-m'.

        * Double angle brackets enclose command names: `<<next-line>>'
          is shorthand for `M-x next-line <RET>'.

        * Finally, `REM' or `;;' causes the rest of the line to be
          ignored as a comment.

     Any word may be prefixed by a multiplier in the form of a decimal
     number and `*': `3*<right>' == `<right> <right> <right>', and
     `10*foo' == `foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo'.

     Multiple text keys can normally be strung together to form a word,
     but you may need to add whitespace if the word would look like one
     of the above notations: `; ; ;' is a keyboard macro with three
     semicolons, but `;;;' is a comment.  Likewise, `\ 1 2 3' is four
     keys but `\123' is a single key written in octal, and `< right >'
     is seven keys but `<right>' is a single function key.  When in
     doubt, use whitespace.

Q5.1.4: What is the performance hit of `let'?
---------------------------------------------

In most cases, not noticeable.  Besides, there's no avoiding `let'--you
have to bind your local variables, after all.  Some pose a question
whether to nest `let's, or use one `let' per function.  I think because
of clarity and maintenance (and possible future implementation),
`let'-s should be used (nested) in a way to provide the clearest code.

Q5.1.5: What is the recommended use of `setq'?
----------------------------------------------

   * Global variables

     You will typically `defvar' your global variable to a default
     value, and use `setq' to set it later.

     It is never a good practice to `setq' user variables (like
     `case-fold-search', etc.), as it ignores the user's choice
     unconditionally.  Note that `defvar' doesn't change the value of a
     variable if it was bound previously.  If you wish to change a
     user-variable temporarily, use `let':

          (let ((case-fold-search nil))
            ...                                   ; code with searches that must be case-sensitive
            ...)

     You will notice the user-variables by their docstrings beginning
     with an asterisk (a convention).

   * Local variables

     Bind them with `let', which will unbind them (or restore their
     previous value, if they were bound) after exiting from the `let'
     form.  Change the value of local variables with `setq' or whatever
     you like (e.g. `incf', `setf' and such).  The `let' form can even
     return one of its local variables.

     Typical usage:

          ;; iterate through the elements of the list returned by
          ;; `hairy-function-that-returns-list'
          (let ((l (hairy-function-that-returns-list)))
            (while l
              ... do something with (car l) ...
              (setq l (cdr l))))

     Another typical usage includes building a value simply to work
     with it.

          ;; Build the mode keymap out of the key-translation-alist
          (let ((inbox (file-truename (expand-file-name box)))
                (i 0))
            ... code dealing with inbox ...
            inbox)

     This piece of code uses the local variable `inbox', which becomes
     unbound (or regains old value) after exiting the form.  The form
     also returns the value of `inbox', which can be reused, for
     instance:

          (setq foo-processed-inbox
                (let .....))

Q5.1.6: What is the typical misuse of `setq' ?
----------------------------------------------

A typical misuse is probably `setq'ing a variable that was meant to be
local.  Such a variable will remain bound forever, never to be
garbage-collected.  For example, the code doing:

     (defun my-function (whatever)
       (setq a nil)
       ... build a large list ...
       ... and exit ...)

   does a bad thing, as `a' will keep consuming memory, never to be
unbound.  The correct thing is to do it like this:

     (defun my-function (whatever)
       (let (a)                              ; default initialization is to nil
         ... build a large list ...
         ... and exit, unbinding `a' in the process  ...)

   Not only is this prettier syntactically, but it makes it possible for
Emacs to garbage-collect the objects which `a' used to reference.

   Note that even global variables should not be `setq'ed without
`defvar'ing them first, because the byte-compiler issues warnings.  The
reason for the warning is the following:

     (defun flurgoze nil)                    ; ok, global internal variable
     ...
     
     (setq flurghoze t)                      ; ops!  a typo, but semantically correct.
                                             ; however, the byte-compiler warns.
     
     While compiling toplevel forms:
     ** assignment to free variable flurghoze

Q5.1.7: I like the `do' form of cl, does it slow things down?
-------------------------------------------------------------

It shouldn't.  Here is what Dave Gillespie has to say about cl.el
performance:

     Many of the advanced features of this package, such as `defun*',
     `loop', and `setf', are implemented as Lisp macros.  In
     byte-compiled code, these complex notations will be expanded into
     equivalent Lisp code which is simple and efficient.  For example,
     the forms

          (incf i n)
          (push x (car p))

     are expanded at compile-time to the Lisp forms

          (setq i (+ i n))
          (setcar p (cons x (car p)))

     which are the most efficient ways of doing these respective
     operations in Lisp.  Thus, there is no performance penalty for
     using the more readable `incf' and `push' forms in your compiled
     code.

     _Interpreted_ code, on the other hand, must expand these macros
     every time they are executed.  For this reason it is strongly
     recommended that code making heavy use of macros be compiled.  (The
     features labelled "Special Form" instead of "Function" in this
     manual are macros.)  A loop using `incf' a hundred times will
     execute considerably faster if compiled, and will also
     garbage-collect less because the macro expansion will not have to
     be generated, used, and thrown away a hundred times.

     You can find out how a macro expands by using the `cl-prettyexpand'
     function.

Q5.1.8: I like recursion, does it slow things down?
---------------------------------------------------

Yes.  Emacs byte-compiler cannot do much to optimize recursion.  But
think well whether this is a real concern in Emacs.  Much of the Emacs
slowness comes from internal mechanisms such as redisplay, or from the
fact that it is an interpreter.

   Please try not to make your code much uglier to gain a very small
speed gain.  It's not usually worth it.

Q5.1.9: How do I put a glyph as annotation in a buffer?
-------------------------------------------------------

Here is a solution that will insert the glyph annotation at the
beginning of buffer:

     (make-annotation (make-glyph '([FORMAT :file FILE]
                                    [string :data "fallback-text"]))
                      (point-min)
                      'text
                      (current-buffer))

   Replace `FORMAT' with an unquoted symbol representing the format of
the image (e.g. `xpm', `xbm', `gif', `jpeg', etc.)  Instead of `FILE',
use the image file name (e.g.
`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-21.4/etc/recycle.xpm').

   You can turn this to a function (that optionally prompts you for a
file name), and inserts the glyph at `(point)' instead of `(point-min)'.

Q5.1.10: `map-extents' won't traverse all of my extents!
--------------------------------------------------------

I tried to use `map-extents' to do an operation on all the extents in a
region.  However, it seems to quit after processing a random number of
extents.  Is it buggy?

   No.  The documentation of `map-extents' states that it will iterate
across the extents as long as FUNCTION returns `nil'.  Unexperienced
programmers often forget to return `nil' explicitly, which results in
buggy code.  For instance, the following code is supposed to delete all
the extents in a buffer, and issue as many `fubar!' messages.

     (map-extents (lambda (ext ignore)
                    (delete-extent ext)
                    (message "fubar!")))

   Instead, it will delete only the first extent, and stop right there -
because `message' will return a non-nil value.  The correct code is:

     (map-extents (lambda (ext ignore)
                    (delete-extent ext)
                    (message "fubar!")
                    nil))

5.3: Miscellaneous
==================

Q5.3.1: How do you make XEmacs indent CL if-clauses correctly?
--------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like XEmacs to indent all the clauses of a Common Lisp `if' the
same amount instead of indenting the 3rd clause differently from the
first two.

   One way is to add, to `init.el'/`.emacs':

     (put 'if 'lisp-indent-function nil)

   However, note that the package `cl-indent' that comes with XEmacs
sets up this kind of indentation by default.  `cl-indent' also knows
about many other CL-specific forms.  To use `cl-indent', one can do
this:

     (load "cl-indent")
     (setq lisp-indent-function (function common-lisp-indent-function))

   One can also customize `cl-indent.el' so it mimics the default `if'
indentation `then' indented more than the `else'.  Here's how:

     (put 'if 'common-lisp-indent-function '(nil nil &body))

   Also, a new version (1.2) of `cl-indent.el' was posted to
comp.emacs.xemacs on 12/9/94.  This version includes more documentation
than previous versions.  This may prove useful if you need to customize
any indent-functions.

   If you don't use a2ps to convert ASCII to postscript (why not, it's

You can specify what paths to use by using a number of different flags
when running configure.  See the section MAKE VARIABLES in the top-level
file INSTALL in the XEmacs distribution for a listing of those flags.

   Most of the time, however, the simplest fix is: *do not* specify
paths as you might for GNU Emacs.  XEmacs can generally determine the
necessary paths dynamically at run time.  The only path that generally
needs to be specified is the root directory to install into.  That can
be specified by passing the `--prefix' flag to configure.  For a
description of the XEmacs install tree, please consult the `NEWS' file.

Q5.3.7: Can I have the end of the buffer delimited in some way?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Say, with: `[END]'?

   Try this:

     (let ((ext (make-extent (point-min) (point-max))))
       (set-extent-property ext 'start-closed t)
       (set-extent-property ext 'end-closed t)
       (set-extent-property ext 'detachable nil)
       (set-extent-end-glyph ext (make-glyph [string :data "[END]"])))

   Since this is XEmacs, you can specify an icon to be shown on
window-system devices.  To do so, change the `make-glyph' call to
something like this:

     (make-glyph '([xpm :file "~/something.xpm"]
                   [string :data "[END]"]))

   You can inline the XPM definition yourself by specifying `:data'
instead of `:file'.  Here is such a full-featured version that works on
both X and TTY devices:

     (let ((ext (make-extent (point-min) (point-max))))
       (set-extent-property ext 'start-closed t)
       (set-extent-property ext 'end-closed t)

                                               [string :data "[END]"]))))

   Note that you might want to make this a function, and put it to a
hook.  We leave that as an exercise for the reader.

Q5.3.9: Are only certain syntactic character classes available for abbrevs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Markus Gutschke <gutschk@uni-muenster.de> writes:

     Yes, abbrevs only expands word-syntax strings. While XEmacs does
     not prevent you from defining (e.g. with `C-x a g' or `C-x a l')
     abbrevs that contain special characters, it will refuse to expand
     them. So you need to ensure, that the abbreviation contains
     letters and digits only. This means that `xd', `d5', and `5d' are
     valid abbrevs, but `&d', and `x d' are not.

     If this sounds confusing to you, (re-)read the online
     documentation for abbrevs (`C-h i m XEmacs <RET> m Abbrevs
     <RET>'), and then come back and read this question/answer again.

   Starting with XEmacs 20.3 this restriction has been lifted.

Q5.3.10: How can I get those oh-so-neat X-Face lines?
-----------------------------------------------------

Firstly there is an ftp site which describes X-faces and has the
associated tools mentioned below, at
`ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/faces/'.

   Then the steps are

  1. Create 48x48x1 bitmap with your favorite tool

  2. Convert to "icon" format using one of xbm2ikon, pbmtoicon, etc.,
     and then compile the face.

  3.      cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon |compface > file.face

  4. Then be sure to quote things that are necessary for emacs strings:

          cat ./file.face | sed 's/\\/\\\\/g'
          | sed 's/\"/\\\"/g' > ./file.face.quoted

  5. Then set up emacs to include the file as a mail header - there
     were a couple of suggestions here--either something like:

          (setq  mail-default-headers
                 "X-Face:  <Ugly looking text string here>")

     Or, alternatively, as:

          (defun mail-insert-x-face ()
            (save-excursion
              (goto-char (point-min))
              (search-forward mail-header-separator)
              (beginning-of-line)
              (insert "X-Face:")
              (insert-file-contents "~/.face")))
          
          (add-hook 'mail-setup-hook 'mail-insert-x-face)

   However, 2 things might be wrong:

   Some versions of pbmtoicon produces some header lines that is not
expected by the version of compface that I grabbed. So I found I had to
include a `tail +3' in the pipeline like this:

     cat file.xbm | xbm2ikon | tail +3 |compface > file.face

   Some people have also found that if one uses the `(insert-file)'
method, one should NOT quote the face string using the sed script .

   It might also be helpful to use Stig's <stig@hackvan.com> script
(included in the compface distribution at XEmacs.org) to do the
conversion.

-------------------------------------------

You use something like:

                                Info-default-directory-list))

   David Masterson <davidm@prism.kla.com> writes:

     Emacs Info and XEmacs Info do many things differently.  If you're
     trying to support a number of versions of Emacs, here are some
     notes to remember:

       1. Emacs Info scans `Info-directory-list' from right-to-left
          while XEmacs Info reads it from left-to-right, so append to
          the _correct_ end of the list.

       2. Use `Info-default-directory-list' to initialize
          `Info-directory-list' _if_ it is available at startup, but not
          all Emacsen define it.

       3. Emacs Info looks for a standard `dir' file in each of the
          directories scanned from #1 and magically concatenates them
          together.

       4. XEmacs Info looks for a `localdir' file (which consists of
          just the menu entries from a `dir' file) in each of the
          directories scanned from #1 (except the first), does a simple
          concatenation of them, and magically attaches the resulting
          list to the end of the menu in the `dir' file in the first
          directory.

     Another alternative is to convert the documentation to HTML with
     texi2html and read it from a web browser like Lynx or W3.

Q5.3.12: What do I need to change to make printing work?
--------------------------------------------------------

For regular printing there are two variables that can be customized.

`lpr-command'
     This should be set to a command that takes standard input and sends
     it to a printer.  Something like:

          (setq lpr-command "lp")

`lpr-switches'
     This should be set to a list that contains whatever the print
     command requires to do its job.  Something like:

          (setq lpr-switches '("-depson"))

   For postscript printing there are three analogous variables to
customize.

`ps-lpr-command'
     This should be set to a command that takes postscript on standard
     input and directs it to a postscript printer.

`ps-lpr-switches'
     This should be set to a list of switches required for
     `ps-lpr-command' to do its job.

`ps-print-color-p'
     This boolean variable should be set `t' if printing will be done in
     color, otherwise it should be set to `nil'.

   NOTE: It is an undocumented limitation in XEmacs that postscript
printing (the `Pretty Print Buffer' menu item) *requires* a window
system environment.  It cannot be used outside of X11.

6.0: General Info
=================

Q6.0.1: What is the status of the XEmacs port to Windows?
---------------------------------------------------------

Is XEmacs really ported to MS Windows?  What is the status of the port?

   Beginning with release 21.0, XEmacs has worked under MS Windows.  A
group of dedicated developers actively maintains and improves the
Windows-specific portions of the code.  The mailing list at
<xemacs-nt@xemacs.org> is dedicated to that effort (please use the
-request address to subscribe). (Despite its name, XEmacs actually
works on all versions of Windows.)

   As of May 2001, XEmacs on MS Windows is stable and full-featured, and
has been so for a year or more - in fact, some features, such as
printing, actually work better on Windows than native Unix.  However,
the internationalization (Mule) support does not work - although this
is being actively worked on.

Q6.0.2: What flavors of MS Windows are supported?  The list name implies NT only.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The list name is misleading, as XEmacs supports and has been compiled on
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows
XP, and all newer versions of Windows.  The MS Windows-specific code is
based on Microsoft Win32 API, and will not work on MS Windows 3.x or on
MS-DOS.

   XEmacs also supports the Cygwin and MinGW development and runtime
environments, where it also uses native Windows code for graphical
features.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q6.0.3,  Next: Q6.0.4,  Prev: Q6.0.2,  Up: MS Windows

Q6.0.3: Are binaries available?
-------------------------------

Binaries are available at `http://www.xemacs.org/Download/win32/' for
the native and Cygwin MS Windows versions of 21.4, and the native
version of 21.1.

   The 21.4 binaries use a modified version of the Cygwin installer.
Run the provided `setup.exe', and follow the instructions.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q6.0.4,  Next: Q6.0.5,  Prev: Q6.0.3,  Up: MS Windows

Q6.0.4: Can I build XEmacs on MS Windows with X support?  Do I need to?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can, but no you do not need to.  In fact, we recommend that you
use a native-GUI version unless you have a specific need for an X
version.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q6.0.5,  Next: Q6.0.6,  Prev: Q6.0.4,  Up: MS Windows

Q6.0.5: I'd like to help out.  What do I do?
--------------------------------------------

It depends on the knowledge and time you possess.  If you are a
programmer, try to build XEmacs and see if you can improve it.
Windows-specific improvements like integration with established Windows
environments are especially sought after.

   Otherwise, you can still help by downloading the binaries, using
XEmacs as your everyday editor and reporting bugs you find to the
mailing list.

   Another area where we need help is the documentation: We need good
documentation for building XEmacs and for using it.  This FAQ is a
small step in that direction.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q6.0.6,  Next: Q6.0.7,  Prev: Q6.0.5,  Up: MS Windows

Q6.0.6: What are Cygwin and MinGW, and do I need them to run XEmacs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To answer the second part of the question: No, you, you don't need
Cygwin or MinGW to build or to run XEmacs.  But if you have them and
want to use them, XEmacs supports these environments.

   (One important reason to support Cygwin is that it lets the MS
Windows developers test out their code in a Unix environment without
actually having to have a Unix machine around.  For this reason alone,
Cygwin support is likely to remain supported for a long time in XEmacs.
Same goes for the X support under Cygwin, for the same reasons.  MinGW
support, on the other hand, depends on volunteers to keep it up to date;
but this is generally not hard.)

   Cygwin is a set of tools providing Unix-like API on top of Win32.
It makes it easy to port large Unix programs without significant
changes to their source code.  It is a development environment as well
as a runtime environment.

   When built with Cygwin, XEmacs supports all display types - TTY, X &
Win32 GUI, and can be built with support for all three simultaneously.
If you build with Win32 GUI support then the Cygwin version uses the
majority of the Windows-specific code, which is mostly related to
display.  If you want to build with X support you need X libraries (and
an X server to display XEmacs on); see *Note Q6.1.4::.  TTY and Win32
GUI require no additional libraries beyond what comes standard with
Cygwin.

   The advantages of the Cygwin version are that it integrates well with
the Cygwin environment for existing Cygwin users; uses configure so
building with different features is very easy; and actively supports X &
TTY.  Furthermore, the entire Cygwin environment and compiler are free,
whereas Visual C++ costs money.

   The disadvantage is that it requires the whole Cygwin environment,
whereas the native port requires only a suitable MS Windows compiler.
Also, it follows the Unix filesystem and process model very closely
(some will undoubtedly view this as an advantage).

   See `http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/' for more information on
Cygwin.

   MinGW is a collection of header files and import libraries that allow
one to use GCC under the Cygwin environment to compile and produce
exactly the same native Win32 programs that you can using Visual C++.
Programs compiled with MinGW make use of the standard Microsoft runtime
library `MSVCRT.DLL', present on all Windows systems, and look, feel,
and act like a standard Visual-C-produced application. (The only
difference is the compiler.) This means that, unlike a
standardly-compiled Cygwin application, no extra runtime support (e.g.
Cygwin's `cygwin1.dll') is required.  This, along with the fact that
GCC is free (and works in a nice Unix-y way in a nice Unix-y
environment, for those die-hard Unix hackers out there), is the main
advantage of MinGW.  It is also potentially faster than Cygwin because
it has less overhead when calling Windows, but you lose the POSIX
emulation layer, which makes Unix programs harder to port. (But this is
irrelevant for XEmacs since it's already ported to Win32.)

   See `http://www.mingw.org/' for more information on MinGW.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q6.0.7,  Next: Q6.1.1,  Prev: Q6.0.6,  Up: MS Windows

Q6.0.7: What exactly are all the different ways to build XEmacs under Windows?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XEmacs can be built in several ways in the MS Windows environment.

   The standard way is what we call the "native" port.  It uses the
Win32 API and has no connection with X whatsoever - it does not require
X libraries to build, nor does it require an X server to run.  The
native port is the most reliable version and provides the best graphical
support.  Almost all development is geared towards this version, and
there is little reason not to use it.

   The second way to build is the Cygwin port.  It takes advantage of
Cygnus emulation library under Win32.  *Note Q6.0.6::, for more
information.

   A third way is the MinGW port.  It uses the Cygwin environment to
build but does not require it at runtime.  *Note Q6.0.6::, for more
information.

   Finally, you might also be able to build the non-Cygwin, non-MinGW
"X" port.  This was actually the first version of XEmacs that ran under
MS Windows, and although the code is still in XEmacs, it's essentially
orphaned and it's unlikely it will compile without a lot of work.  If
you want an MS Windows versin of XEmacs that supports X, use the Cygwin
version. (The X support there is actively maintained, so that Windows
developers can test the X support in XEmacs.)

6.1: Building XEmacs on MS Windows
==================================

Q6.1.1: What compiler/libraries do I need to compile XEmacs?
------------------------------------------------------------

You need Visual C++ 4.2, 5.0, or 6.0 for the native version. (We have
some beta testers currently trying to compile with VC.NET, aka version
7.0, but we can't yet report complete success.) For the Cygwin and MinGW
versions, you need the Cygwin environment, which comes with GCC, the
compiler used for those versions.  *Note Q6.0.6::, for more information
on Cygwin and MinGW.

Please read the file `nt/README' in the XEmacs distribution, which
contains the full description.


File: xemacs-faq.info,  Node: Q6.1.3,  Next: Q6.1.4,  Prev: Q6.1.2,  Up: MS Windows

Q6.1.3: What do I need for Cygwin?
----------------------------------

You can find the Cygwin tools and compiler at:

   `http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/'

   Click on the `Install now!' link, which will download a file
`setup.exe', which you can use to download everything else. (You will
need to pick a mirror site; `mirrors.rcn.net' is probably the best.)
You should go ahead and install everything - you'll get various
ancillary libraries that XEmacs needs or likes, e.g. XPM, PNG, JPEG,
TIFF, etc.

   If you want to compile under X, you will also need the X libraries;
see *Note Q6.1.6::.

   If you want to compile without X, you will need the `xpm-nox'
library, which must be specifically selected in the Cygwin netinstaller;
it is not selected by default.  The package has had various names.
Currently it is called `cygXpm-noX4.dll'.

Q6.1.4: How do I compile under Cygwin?
--------------------------------------

Similar as on Unix; use the usual `configure' and `make' process.  Some
problems to watch out for:

   * make sure HOME is set. This controls where you `init.el'/`.emacs'
     file comes from;

   * CYGWIN needs to be set to tty for process support to work, e.g.
     CYGWIN=tty;

   * picking up some other grep or other UNIX-like tools can kill
     configure;

   * static heap too small, adjust `src/sheap-adjust.h' to a more
     positive number;

   * (Unconfirmed) The Cygwin version doesn't understand
     `//machine/path' type paths so you will need to manually mount a
     directory of this form under a unix style directory for a build to
     work on the directory;

   * If you're building *WITHOUT* X11, don't forget to change symlinks
     `/usr/lib/libXpm.a' and `/usr/lib/libXpm.dll.a' to point to the
     non-X versions of these libraries.  By default they point to the X
     versions.  So:

          /usr/lib/libXpm.a     -> /usr/lib/libXpm-noX.a
          /usr/lib/libXpm.dll.a -> /usr/lib/libXpm-noX.dll.a

     (This advice may now be obsolete because of the availability of the
     cygXpm-noX4.dll package from Cygwin.  Send confirmation to
     <faq@xemacs.org>.)

   * Other problems are listed in the `PROBLEMS' file, in the top-level
     directory of the XEmacs sources.

Q6.1.5: How do I compile using MinGW (aka `the -mno-cygwin flag to gcc')?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similar to the method for Unix.  Things to remember:

   * Specify the target host on the command line for `./configure', e.g.
     `./configure i586-pc-mingw32'.

   * Be sure that your build directory is mounted such that it has the
     same path either as a cygwin path (`/build/xemacs') or as a Windows
     path (`c:\build\xemacs').

   * Build `gcc -mno-cygwin' versions of the extra libs, i.e. `libpng',
     `compface', etc.

   * Specify the target location of the extra libs on the command line
     to `configure', e.g.  `./configure --site-prefixes=/build/libs
     i586-pc-mingw32'.

Q6.1.6: I decided to run with X.  Where do I get an X server?
-------------------------------------------------------------

As of May 2001, we are recommending that you use the port of XFree86 to
Cygwin.  This has recently stabilized, and will undoubtedly soon make
most other MS Windows X servers obsolete.  It is what the Windows
developers use to test the MS Windows X support.

   To install, go to `http://xfree86.cygwin.com/'.  There is a detailed
description on that site of exactly how to install it.  This
installation also provides the libraries, include files, and other stuff
needed for development; a large collection of internationalized fonts;
the standard X utilities (xterm, twm, etc.) - in a word, the works.

   NOTE: As of late May 2001, there is a bug in the file
`startxwin.bat', used to start X Windows.  It passes the option
`-engine -4' to the X server, which is bogus - you need to edit the
file and change it to `-engine 4'.

Q6.1.7: How do I compile with X support?
----------------------------------------

To compile under Cygwin, all you need to do is install XFree86 (*note
Q6.1.6::).  Once installed, `configure' should automatically find the X
libraries and compile with X support.

   As noted above, the non-Cygwin X support is basically orphaned, and
probably won't work.  But if it want to try, it's described in
`nt/README' in some detail.  Basically, you need to get X11 libraries
from ftp.x.org, and compile them.  If the precompiled versions are
available somewhere, we don't know of it.

6.2: Customization and User Interface
=====================================

Q6.2.1: How does the port cope with differences in the Windows user interface?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The XEmacs (and Emacs in general) user interface is pretty different
from what is expected of a typical MS Windows program.  How does the MS
Windows port cope with it?

   As a general rule, we follow native MS Windows conventions as much as
possible.  21.4 is a fairly complete Windows application, supporting
native printing, system file dialog boxes, tool tips, etc.  In cases
where there's a clear UI conflict, we currently use normal Unix XEmacs
behavior by default, but make sure the MS Windows "look and feel" (mark
via shift-arrow, self-inserting deletes region, Alt selects menu items,
etc.) is easily configurable (respectively: using the variable
`shifted-motion-keys-select-region' in 21.4 and above [it's in fact the
default in these versions], or the `pc-select' package; using the
`pending-del' package; and setting the variable
`menu-accelerator-enabled' to `menu-force' in 21.4 and above).  In
fact, if you use the sample `init.el' file as your init file, you will
get all these behaviors automatically turned on.

   In future versions, some of these features might be turned on by
default in the MS Windows environment.

Q6.2.2: How do I change fonts in XEmacs on MS Windows?
------------------------------------------------------

In 21.4 and above, you can use the "Options" menu to change the font.
You can also do it in your init file, e.g. like this:

         (set-face-font 'default "Lucida Console:Regular:10")
         (set-face-font 'modeline "MS Sans Serif:Regular:10")

`init.el' is the name of the init file starting with 21.4, and is
located in the subdirectory `.xemacs/' of your home directory.  In
prior versions, the init file is called `.emacs' and is located in your
home directory.  Your home directory under Windows is determined by the
`HOME' environment variable.  If this is not set, it defaults to `C:\'.

   To set this variable, modify `AUTOEXEC.BAT' under Windows 95/98, or
select `Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables...'
under Windows NT/2000.

Q6.2.4: How do I get Windows Explorer to associate a file type with XEmacs?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Associating a new file type with XEmacs.
........................................

In Explorer select `View/Options/File Types', press `[New Type...]' and
fill in the dialog box, e.g.:

             Description of type:    Emacs Lisp source
             Associated extension:   el
             Content Type (MIME):    text/plain

   then press `[New...]' and fill in the `Action' dialog box as follows:

             Action:
             Open
     
             Application used to perform action:
             D:\Full\path\for\xemacs.exe "%1"
     
             [x] Use DDE
     
             DDE Message:
             open("%1")
     
             Application:
             <leave blank>
     
             DDE Application Not Running:
             <leave blank>
     
             Topic:
             <leave blank>

Associating an existing file type with XEmacs.
..............................................

In Explorer select `View/Options/File Types'.  Click on the file type
in the list and press `[Edit...]'.  If the file type already has an
`Open' action, double click on it and fill in the `Action' dialog box
as described above; otherwise create a new action.

   If the file type has more than one action listed, you probably want
to make the `Open' action that you just edited the default by clicking
on it and pressing `Set Default'.

   Note for Windows 2000 users: Under Windows 2000, get to `File Types'
using `Control Panel->Folder Options->File Types'.

Q6.2.5: Is it possible to print from XEmacs?
--------------------------------------------

As of 21.4, printing works on Windows, using simply `File->Print', and
can be configured with `File->Page Setup'.

   Prior to 21.4, there is no built-in support, but there are some
clever hacks out there.  If you know how, please let us know and we'll
put it here.

6.3: Miscellaneous
==================

Q6.3.1: Does XEmacs rename all the `win32-*' symbols to `w32-*'?
----------------------------------------------------------------

In his flavor of Emacs 20, Richard Stallman has renamed all the
`win32-*' symbols to `w32-*'.  Does XEmacs do the same?

   We consider such a move counter-productive, thus we do not use the
`w32' prefix. (His rather questionable justification was that he did
not consider Windows to be a "winning" platform.) However, the name
`Win32' is not particularly descriptive outside the Windows world, and
using just `windows-' would be too generic.  So we chose a compromise,
the prefix `mswindows-' for Windows-related variables and functions.

   Thus all the XEmacs variables and functions directly related to
either the Windows GUI or OS are prefixed `mswindows-' (except for a
couple of debugging variables, prefixed `debug-mswindows-').  From an
architectural perspective, however, we believe that this is mostly a
non-issue because there should be a very small number of
window-systems-specific variables anyway.  Whenever possible, we try to
provide generic interfaces that apply to all window systems.

Q6.3.2: What are the differences between the various MS Windows emacsen?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

XEmacs, Win-Emacs, DOS Emacs, NT Emacs, this is all very confusing.
Could you briefly explain the differences between them?

   Here is a recount of various Emacs versions running on MS Windows:

   * XEmacs

        - Beginning with XEmacs 19.12, XEmacs' architecture was
          redesigned in such a way to allow clean support of multiple
          window systems.  At this time the TTY support was added,
          making X and TTY the first two "window systems" supported by
          XEmacs.  The 19.12 design is the basis for the current native
          MS Windows code.

        - Some time during 1997, David Hobley (soon joined by Marc
          Paquette) imported some of the NT-specific portions of GNU
          Emacs, making XEmacs with X support compile under Windows NT,
          and creating the "X" port.

        - Several months later, Jonathan Harris sent out initial
          patches to use the Win32 API, thus creating the native port.
          Since then, various people have contributed, including Kirill
          M. Katsnelson (contributed support for menubars, subprocesses
          and network, as well as loads of other code), Andy Piper
          (ported XEmacs to Cygwin environment, contributed Windows
          unexec, Windows-specific glyphs and toolbars code, and more),
          Ben Wing (loads of improvements; primary MS Windows developer
          since 2000), Jeff Sparkes (contributed scrollbars support)
          and many others.

   * NT Emacs

        - NT Emacs is a version of GNU Emacs modified to compile and
          run under MS Windows 95 and NT using the native Win32 API.
          As such, it is close in spirit to the XEmacs "native" port.

        - NT Emacs has been written by Geoff Voelker, and more
          information can be found at
          `http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html'.

   * Win-Emacs

        - Win-Emacs was a port of Lucid Emacs 19.6 to MS Windows using X
          compatibility libraries.  Win-Emacs was written by Ben Wing.
          The MS Windows code never made it back to Lucid Emacs, and
          its creator (Pearl Software) has long since gone out of
          business.

   * GNU Emacs for DOS

        - GNU Emacs features support for MS-DOS and DJGPP (D.J.
          Delorie's DOS port of GCC).  Such an Emacs is heavily
          underfeatured, because it does not support long file names,
          lacks proper subprocesses support, and is far too big
          compared with typical DOS editors.

   * GNU Emacs compiled with Win32

        - Starting with version 19.30, it has been possible to compile
          GNU Emacs under MS Windows using the DJGPP compiler and X
          libraries.  The result is very similar to GNU Emacs compiled
          under MS DOS, only it works somewhat better because it runs
          in 32-bit mode, makes use of all the system memory, supports
          long file names, etc.

Q6.3.3: XEmacs 21.1 on Windows used to spawn an ugly console window on every startup.  Has that been fixed?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

   The console was there because `temacs' (and in turn, `xemacs') was a
console application, and Windows typically creates a new console for a
console process unless the creating process requests that one isn't
created.  This used to be fixed with `runemacs', a small Windows
application that existed merely to start `xemacs', stating that it
didn't want a console.

   XEmacs 21.4 fixes this cleanly by the virtue of being a true "GUI"
application.  The explanation of what that means is included for
educational value.

   When building an application to be run in a Win32 environment, you
must state which sub-system it is to run in.  Valid subsystems include
"console" and "gui".  The subsystem you use affects the run time
libraries linked into your application, the start up function that is
run before control is handed over to your application, the entry point
to your program, and how Windows normally invokes your program. (Console
programs automatically get a console created for them at startup if
their stdin/stdout don't point anywhere useful, which is the case when
run from the GUI.  This is a stupid design, of course - instead, the
console should get created only when the first I/O actually occurs!
GUI programs have an equally stupid design: When called from
`CMD.EXE'/`COMMAND.COM', their stdin/stdout will be set to point
nowhere useful, even though the command shell has its own stdin/stdout.
It's as if someone who had learned a bit about stdio but had no actual
knowledge of interprocess communication designed the scheme;
unfortunately, the whole process-communication aspect of the Win32 API
is equally badly designed.) For example, the entry point for a console
app is "main" (which is what you'd expect for a C/C++ program), but the
entry point for a "gui" app is "WinMain".  This confuses and annoys a
lot of programmers who've grown up on Unix systems, where the kernel
doesn't really care whether your application is a gui program or not.

   For reasons not altogether clear, and are lost in the mists of time
and tradition, XEmacs on Win32 started out as a console application, and
therefore a console was automatically created for it. (It may have been
made a console application partly because a console is needed in some
circumstances, especially under Win95, to interrupt, terminate, or send
signals to a child process, and because of the bogosity mentioned above
with GUI programs and the standard command shell.  Currently, XEmacs
just creates and immediately hides a console when necessary, and works
around the "no useful stdio" problem by creating its own console window
as necessary to display messages in.)

Q6.3.4: What is the porting team doing at the moment?
-----------------------------------------------------

(as of June 2001)

   The porting team is continuing work on the MS Windows-specific code.
Major projects are the development of Mule (internationalization)
support for Windows and the improvement of the widget support (better
support for dialog boxes, buttons, edit fields, and similar UI
elements).

6.3: Troubleshooting
====================

Q6.4.1 XEmacs won't start on Windows.
-------------------------------------

XEmacs relies on a process called "dumping" to generate a working
executable. Under MS-Windows this process effectively fixes the memory
addresses of information in the executable. When XEmacs starts up it
tries to reserve these memory addresses so that the dumping process can
be reversed - putting the information back at the correct addresses.
Unfortunately some .DLLs (for instance the soundblaster driver) occupy
memory addresses that can conflict with those needed by the dumped
XEmacs executable. In this instance XEmacs will fail to start without
any explanation. Note that this is extremely machine specific.

   21.1.10 includes a fix for this that makes more intelligent guesses
about which memory addresses will be free, and this should cure the
problem for most people.  21.4 implements "portable dumping", which
eliminates the problem altogether.  We recommend you use the 21.4
binaries, but you can use the 21.1 binaries if you are very paranoid
about stability.  *Note Q6.0.3::.

Q6.4.2 Why do I get a blank toolbar on Windows 95?
--------------------------------------------------

You need at least version 4.71 of the system file `comctl32.dll'.  The
updated version is supplied with Internet Explorer 4 and later but if
you are avoiding IE you can also download it from the Microsoft web
site.  Go into support and search for `comctl32.dll'.  The download is
a self-installing executable.

Q6.4.3 XEmacs complains "No such file or directory, diff"
---------------------------------------------------------

or "ispell" or other commands that seem related to whatever you just
tried to do (M-x ediff or M-$, for example).

   There are a large number of common (in the sense that "everyone has
these, they really do") Unix utilities that are not provided with
XEmacs.  The GNU Project's implementations are available for Windows in
the the Cygwin distribution (`http://www.cygwin.com/'), which also
provides a complete Unix emulation environment (and thus makes ports of
Unix utilities nearly trivial).  Another implementation is that from
MinGW (`http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml').  If you know of others,
please let us know!

interesting items that have transpired recently. (But in practice it's
not getting updated like this.)

   This section also contains descriptions of the new features in all
the recent releases of XEmacs.  For the most part, the information
below is a synopsis of the more complete information that can be found
in the file `NEWS' in the `etc' directory of the XEmacs distribution.
You can view this file in XEmacs using `C-h n' or the `Help' menu.

   Information on older versions of XEmacs can be find in `ONEWS' in
the same directory, or `OONEWS' for really old versions.

Q7.0.2: What's new in XEmacs 21.4?
----------------------------------

21.4 was the "stable" version of the 21.2 series, which was considered
"experimental" throughout its life; thus there were no "official"
releases at all.  In essence, XEmacs is now following the "alternating"
scheme of Linux, where at any point there are at least two different
development branches, one "stable" and one "experimental".  Periodic
releases happen in both branches, but those in the experimental branch
are not tested as well, and there's no guarantee they will work at all.
The experiemental branch is open to any and all code that's acceptable
to the developers; the stable branch, however, is in general limited
only to bug fixes, and all contributions are carefully reviewed to make
sure they will increase and not decrease stability.

   21.3 never existed at all; it was decided to follow the Linux scheme
exactly, where odd-numbered series are experimental and even-numbered
ones stable.

   The following lists summarizes the essential changes made in this
version.  For a fuller list, see the `NEWS' in the `etc' directory of
the XEmacs distribution, or use `C-h n' or the `Help' menu to view this
file inside of XEmacs.

User-visible changes in XEmacs 21.4
...................................

   * The delete key now deletes forward by default.

   * Shifted motion keys now select text by default.

   * You can now build XEmacs with support for GTK+ widget set.

   * ~/.xemacs/init.el is now the preferred location for the init file.
     (XEmacs now supports a `~/.xemacs/init.el' startup file. Custom
     file will move to ~/.xemacs/custom.el.)

   * Much-improved sample init.el, showing how to use many useful
     features.

   * XEmacs support for menu accelerators has been much improved.

   * Default menubar improvements. (Default menubar has many new
     commands and better organization.  The font-menu is now available
     under MS Windows.)

   * Dialog box improvements, including a real file dialog box. (XEmacs
     now has a proper file dialog box under MS Windows (and GTK)!  The
     old clunky file dialog box is improved.  Keyboard traversal now
     works correctly in MS Windows dialog boxes.  There is a Search
     dialog box available from Edit->Find...)

   * There is a new MS Windows installer, netinstall, ported from
     Cygwin.

   * The subprocess quote-handling mechanism under Windows is much
     improved.

   * Printing support now available under MS Windows.

   * Selection improvements. (Kill and yank now interact with the
     clipboard under Windows.  MS Windows support for selection is now
     much more robust.  Motif selection support is now more correct
     (but slower).)

   * Mail spool locking now works correctly.

   * International support changes. (The default coding-priority-list
     is now safer.  International keysyms are now supported under X.
     MS Windows 1251 code page now supported.  Czech, Thai,
     Cyrillic-KOI8, Vietnamese, Ethiopic now supported.  Proper support
     for words in Latin 3 and Latin 4.)

   * Help buffers contain hyperlinks, and other changes.

   * The modeline's text is now scrollable.

   * The mouse wheel under MS Windows now functions correctly.

   * Interactive searching and matching case improvements. (Incremental
     search will now highlight all visible matches.  Interactive
     searches always respect uppercase characters.)

   * Rectangle functions rewritten to avoid inserting extra spaces.

   * New command `kill-entire-line' that always kills the entire line.

   * Default values correctly stored in minibuffer histories.

   * You can now create "indirect buffers", like in GNU Emacs.

21.1 was the "stable" version of "experimental" 21.0 series.  *Note
Q7.0.2::.

   The following lists summarizes the essential changes made in this
version.  For a fuller list, see the `NEWS' in the `etc' directory of
the XEmacs distribution, or use `C-h n' or the `Help' menu to view this
file inside of XEmacs.

User-visible changes in XEmacs 21.1
...................................

   * XEmacs is now supported under Microsoft Windows 95/98 and Windows
     NT operating systems.  To discuss Windows-specific issues,
     subscribe to the mailing list at <xemacs-nt-request@xemacs.org>.

   * XEmacs has been unbundled into constituent installable packages.

   * *Other notable changes*: The `Options' menu has been ported to
     Custom; XEmacs now is able to choose X visuals and use private
     colormaps; You can drag the vertical divider of "horizontally"
     (side-by-side) split windows.

   * *Building changes*: XEmacs can be built with support for 31-bit
     Lisp integers and 32-bit pointers (previously, it was 28-bit
     integers and pointers); XEmacs can be built with LDAP support;
     `dir' files can be removed in the Info subsystem, and will be
     regenerated on-the-fly.

   * *New packages*: `imenu', `popper', `gdb-highlight'

   * *Package changes*: Many changes to `cc-mode', `gnus', `gnuclient'.
     See `NEWS' for full details.

   * *New commands, variables and functions*: `center-to-window-line'
     (like `recenter' but doesn't force a redisplay); variable
     `user-full-name' (customize what your full name looks like in
     mail); `M-x customize-changed-options' (customize options whose
     default values changes because you upgraded your XEmacs); `M-x
     add-log-convert' (converts an old-style ChangeLog buffer to
     new-style); `M-x zap-up-to-char' (like `zap-to-char' but doesn't
     delete the char searched for); commands to store, retrieve and
     increment numbers in registers, useful for macros.

   * *Changes to commands, variables, and functions*: `M-x
     query-replace' and friends operate only on the region when it's
     active; `echo-keystrokes' can now be a floating-point number; `M-.'
     searches exact tag matches before inexact ones; function
     `user-full-name' with no arguments returns the var
     `user-full-name'; a prefix arg to `M-:' and `C-h c' inserts the
     result in the current buffer.

   * *Other changes*: Under X, new application class `XEmacs';
     byte-compilation of user-specs now works.

   * *XEmacs/Mule (internationalization) changes*: Mule support now
     works on TTY's; Egg/SJ3 input method now officially supported
     (Quail and Egg/Skk already available through LEIM since 20.3);
     localized Japanese menubars if XEmacs is built with the right
     support.


Lisp and internal changes in XEmacs 21.1
........................................

   * *Specifier changes*: The window locale now has a higher precedence
     than the buffer locale when instantiating; new macro
     `let-specifier'; new specifiers `vertical-scrollbar-visible-p',
     horizontal-scrollbar-visible-p', `scrollbar-on-left-p',
     `scrollbar-on-top-p', `vertical-divider-always-visible-p',
     `vertical-divider-shadow-thickness',
     `vertical-divider-line-width', `vertical-divider-spacing';
     specifiers and symbols whose value is a specifier allowed as
     modeline specifications.

   * *Frame focus changes*: `focus-follows-mouse' works like FSF,
     prevents any attempt to permanently change the selected frame; new
     function `focus-frame' sets the window system focus a frame; new
     special forms `save-selected-frame' and `with-selected-frame'.

   * *Window function changes*: `select-window' now has optional
     argument NORECORD to inhibit recording a buffer change;
     `vertical-motion' now correctly handles optional WINDOW argument
     and has new optional argument PIXELS, to have the returned values
     be in pixels; new function `vertical-motion-pixels'; new functions
     `window-text-area-pixel-{width,height,edges}'; new functions
     `shrink-window-pixels' and `enlarge-window-pixels'; new function
     `window-displayed-text-pixel-height'.

   * *Other function changes*: Arithmetic comparison functions `<',
     `>', `=', `/=' now accept a variable number of arguments;
     hashtables now have a consistent read/print syntax; keyword
     symbols cannot be set to a value other than themselves; `concat' no
     longer accepts integer arguments; new function `string', like
     `list', `vector', etc.; new function `temp-directory'
     (OS-independent way to get a temp directory); `load-average' has
     optional argument USE-FLOATS; `make-event' implemented completely;
     new function `function-interactive' (returns a function's
     interactive spec); new functions `lmessage', `lwarn' (printf-like
     versions of `display-wessage', `display-warning'); new keyword
     `:version' to `defcustom'.

   * *Performance*: when the new GNU Malloc aka Doug Lea Malloc is
     available, it will be used (better performance on libc6 Linux
     systems); tracking line-numbers in modeline is now efficient;
     profiling records a call-count of all called functions,
     retrievable through `profile-call-count-results'.

   * *Startup and path searching*: code to assemble paths at startup
     rewritten for new package system; new function `split-path' (splits
     by `path-separator'); `Info-default-directory-list' obsolete, use
     `Info-directory-list' instead; site-lisp is deprecated and no
     longer on the load-path by default.

additional support for Mule (Multi-language extensions to Emacs), many
more customizations, multiple frames on TTY-s, support for multiple info
directories, an enhanced gnuclient, improvements to regexp matching,
increased MIME support, and many, many synches with GNU Emacs 20.

   The XEmacs/Mule support has been only seriously tested in a Japanese
locale, and no doubt many problems still remain.  The support for
ISO-Latin-1 and Japanese is fairly strong.  MULE support comes at a
price--about a 30% slowdown from 19.16.  We're making progress on
improving performance and XEmacs 20.3 compiled without Mule (which is
the default) is definitely faster than XEmacs 19.16.

   XEmacs 20.3 is the first non-beta v20 release, and will be the basis
for all further development.

Q7.0.6: What's new in XEmacs 20.2?
----------------------------------

The biggest changes in 20.2 include integration of EFS (the next
generation of ange-ftp) and AUC Tex (the Emacs subsystem that includes a
major mode for editing Tex and LaTeX, and a lot of other stuff).  Many
bugs from 20.0 have been fixed for this release.  20.2 also contains a
new system for customizing XEmacs options, invoked via `M-x customize'.

   XEmacs 20.2 is the development release (20.0 was beta), and is no
longer considered unstable.

   For older news, see the file `ONEWS' in the `etc' directory of the
XEmacs distribution.

8 New information about old XEmacsen
************************************

This is part 8 of the XEmacs Frequently Asked Questions list.  It will
occasionally be updated to reflect new information about versions which
are no longer being revised by the XEmacs Project.  The primary purpose
is advice on compatibility of older XEmacsen with new packages and
updated versions of packages, but bug fixes (which will not be applied
to released XEmacsen, but users can apply themselves) are also accepted.

Q8.0.1: Gnus 5.10 won't display smileys in XEmacs 21.1.

     Previously I wrote:

     After a bit of sleuthing, I discovered the essence of the problem.
     For me, the form:

              	(with-temp-buffer
              	  (insert-file-contents "foo.xpm")
              	  (buffer-string))

     returns the empty string.  This is because something somewhere
     replaces the XPM data with a glyph -- I haven't figured out where
     this occurs.

   Kyle Jones <kyle_jones@wonderworks.com> replies:

     Do this:

              (setq format-alist nil)

     The image-mode stuff is gone from format-alist in the 21.4 branch,
     praise be.
