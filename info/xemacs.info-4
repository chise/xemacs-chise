27.13 Reporting Bugs
====================

Sometimes you will encounter a bug in Emacs.  Although we cannot promise
we can or will fix the bug, and we might not even agree that it is a
bug, we want to hear about bugs you encounter in case we do want to fix
them.

   To make it possible for us to fix a bug, you must report it.  In
order to do so effectively, you must know when and how to do it.

27.13.1 When Is There a Bug
---------------------------

If Emacs executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating
system error message that indicates a problem in the program (as
opposed to something like "disk full"), then it is certainly a bug.

   If Emacs updates the display in a way that does not correspond to
what is in the buffer, then it is certainly a bug.  If a command seems
to do the wrong thing but the problem corrects itself if you type
`C-l', it is a case of incorrect display updating.

   Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
certain that it was really Emacs's fault.  Some commands simply take a
long time.  Type `C-g' and then `C-h l' to see whether the input Emacs
received was what you intended to type; if the input was such that you
KNOW it should have been processed quickly, report a bug.  If you don't
know whether the command should take a long time, find out by looking
in the manual or by asking for assistance.

   If a command you are familiar with causes an Emacs error message in a
case where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably a
bug.

   If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure you
know for certain what it ought to have done.  If you aren't familiar
with the command, or don't know for certain how the command is supposed
to work, then it might actually be working right.  Rather than jumping
to conclusions, show the problem to someone who knows for certain.

   Finally, a command's intended definition may not be best for editing
with.  This is a very important sort of problem, but it is also a
matter of judgment.  Also, it is easy to come to such a conclusion out
of ignorance of some of the existing features.  It is probably best not
to complain about such a problem until you have checked the
documentation in the usual ways, feel confident that you understand it,
and know for certain that what you want is not available.  If you are
not sure what the command is supposed to do after a careful reading of
the manual, check the index and glossary for any terms that may be
unclear.  If you still do not understand, this indicates a bug in the
manual.  The manual's job is to make everything clear.  It is just as
important to report documentation bugs as program bugs.

   If the online documentation string of a function or variable
disagrees with the manual, one of them must be wrong, so report the bug.

27.13.2 How to Report a Bug
---------------------------

When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and to
report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an exact
description of what commands you type, starting with the shell command
to run Emacs, until the problem happens.  Always include the version
number of Emacs that you are using; type `M-x emacs-version' to print
this.

   The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report FACTS,
not hypotheses or categorizations.  It is always easier to report the
facts, but people seem to prefer to strain to posit explanations and
report them instead.  If the explanations are based on guesses about
how Emacs is implemented, they will be useless; we will have to try to
figure out what the facts must have been to lead to such speculations.
Sometimes this is impossible.  But in any case, it is unnecessary work
for us.

   For example, suppose that you type `C-x C-f /glorp/baz.ugh <RET>',
visiting a file which (you know) happens to be rather large, and Emacs
prints out `I feel pretty today'.  The best way to report the bug is
with a sentence like the preceding one, because it gives all the facts
and nothing but the facts.

   Do not assume that the problem is due to the size of the file and
say, "When I visit a large file, Emacs prints out `I feel pretty
today'."  This is what we mean by "guessing explanations".  The problem
is just as likely to be due to the fact that there is a `z' in the file
name.  If this is so, then when we got your report, we would try out
the problem with some "large file", probably with no `z' in its name,
and not find anything wrong.  There is no way in the world that we
could guess that we should try visiting a file with a `z' in its name.

   Alternatively, the problem might be due to the fact that the file
starts with exactly 25 spaces.  For this reason, you should make sure
that you inform us of the exact contents of any file that is needed to
reproduce the bug.  What if the problem only occurs when you have typed
the `C-x a l' command previously?  This is why we ask you to give the
exact sequence of characters you typed since starting to use Emacs.

   You should not even say "visit a file" instead of `C-x C-f' unless
you know that it makes no difference which visiting command is used.
Similarly, rather than saying "if I have three characters on the line,"
say "after I type `<RET> A B C <RET> C-p'," if that is the way you
entered the text.

   If you are not in Fundamental mode when the problem occurs, you
should say what mode you are in.

   If the manifestation of the bug is an Emacs error message, it is
important to report not just the text of the error message but a
backtrace showing how the Lisp program in Emacs arrived at the error.
To make the backtrace, you must execute the Lisp expression `(setq
debug-on-error t)' before the error happens (that is to say, you must
execute that expression and then make the bug happen).  This causes the
Lisp debugger to run (*note Lisp Debug::).  The debugger's backtrace
can be copied as text into the bug report.  This use of the debugger is
possible only if you know how to make the bug happen again.  Do note
the error message the first time the bug happens, so if you can't make
it happen again, you can report at least that.

   Check whether any programs you have loaded into the Lisp world,
including your init file, set any variables that may affect the
functioning of Emacs.  *Note Init File::.  Also, see whether the
problem happens in a freshly started Emacs without loading your init
file (start Emacs with the `-q' switch to prevent loading the init
file).  If the problem does NOT occur then, it is essential that we
know the contents of any programs that you must load into the Lisp
world in order to cause the problem to occur.

   If the problem does depend on an init file or other Lisp programs
that are not part of the standard Emacs system, then you should make
sure it is not a bug in those programs by complaining to their
maintainers first.  After they verify that they are using Emacs in a
way that is supposed to work, they should report the bug.

   If you can tell us a way to cause the problem without visiting any
files, please do so.  This makes it much easier to debug.  If you do
need files, make sure you arrange for us to see their exact contents.
For example, it can often matter whether there are spaces at the ends
of lines, or a newline after the last line in the buffer (nothing ought
to care whether the last line is terminated, but tell that to the bugs).

   The easy way to record the input to Emacs precisely is to write a
dribble file; execute the Lisp expression:

     (open-dribble-file "~/dribble")

using `Meta-<ESC>' or from the `*scratch*' buffer just after starting
Emacs.  From then on, all Emacs input will be written in the specified
dribble file until the Emacs process is killed.

   For possible display bugs, it is important to report the terminal
type (the value of environment variable `TERM'), the complete termcap
entry for the terminal from `/etc/termcap' (since that file is not
identical on all machines), and the output that Emacs actually sent to
the terminal.  The way to collect this output is to execute the Lisp
expression:

     (open-termscript "~/termscript")

using `Meta-<ESC>' or from the `*scratch*' buffer just after starting
Emacs.  From then on, all output from Emacs to the terminal will be
written in the specified termscript file as well, until the Emacs
process is killed.  If the problem happens when Emacs starts up, put
this expression into your init file so that the termscript file will be
open when Emacs displays the screen for the first time.  *Note Init
File::. Be warned: it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to
fix a terminal-dependent bug without access to a terminal of the type
that stimulates the bug.

File: xemacs.info,  Node: Glossary,  Next: Manifesto,  Prev: Intro,  Up: Top

Glossary
********

Abbrev
     An abbrev is a text string which expands into a different text
     string when present in the buffer.  For example, you might define
     a short word as an abbrev for a long phrase that you want to insert
     frequently.  *Note Abbrevs::.

Aborting
     Aborting means getting out of a recursive edit (q.v.).  You can use
     the commands `C-]' and `M-x top-level' for this.  *Note Quitting::.

Auto Fill mode
     Auto Fill mode is a minor mode in which text you insert is
     automatically broken into lines of fixed width.  *Note Filling::.

Auto Saving
     Auto saving means that Emacs automatically stores the contents of
     an Emacs buffer in a specially-named file so the information will
     not be lost if the buffer is lost due to a system error or user
     error.  *Note Auto Save::.

Backup File
     A backup file records the contents that a file had before the
     current editing session.  Emacs creates backup files automatically
     to help you track down or cancel changes you later regret.  *Note
     Backup::.

Balance Parentheses
     Emacs can balance parentheses manually or automatically.  Manual
     balancing is done by the commands to move over balanced expressions
     (*note Lists::).  Automatic balancing is done by blinking the
     parenthesis that matches one just inserted (*note Matching Parens:
     Matching.).

Bind
     To bind a key is to change its binding (q.v.).  *Note Rebinding::.

Binding
     A key gets its meaning in Emacs by having a binding which is a
     command (q.v.), a Lisp function that is run when the key is typed.
     *Note Binding: Commands.  Customization often involves rebinding a
     character to a different command function.  The bindings of all
     keys are recorded in the keymaps (q.v.).  *Note Keymaps::.

Blank Lines
     Blank lines are lines that contain only whitespace.  Emacs has
     several commands for operating on the blank lines in a buffer.

Buffer
     The buffer is the basic editing unit; one buffer corresponds to one
     piece of text being edited.  You can have several buffers, but at
     any time you are editing only one, the `selected' buffer, though
     several buffers can be visible when you are using multiple
     windows.  *Note Buffers::.

Buffer Selection History
     Emacs keeps a buffer selection history which records how recently
     each Emacs buffer was selected.  Emacs uses this list when
     choosing a buffer to select.  *Note Buffers::.

C-
     `C' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for Control.
     *Note C-: Keystrokes.

C-M-
     `C-M-' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for
     Control-Meta.  *Note C-M-: Keystrokes.

Case Conversion
     Case conversion means changing text from upper case to lower case
     or vice versa.  *Note Case::, for the commands for case conversion.

Characters
     Characters form the contents of an Emacs buffer; also, Emacs
     commands are invoked by keys (q.v.), which are sequences of one or
     more characters.  *Note Keystrokes::.

Command
     A command is a Lisp function specially defined to be able to serve
     as a key binding in Emacs.  When you type a key (q.v.), Emacs
     looks up its binding (q.v.) in the relevant keymaps (q.v.) to find
     the command to run.  *Note Commands::.

Command Name
     A command name is the name of a Lisp symbol which is a command
     (*note Commands::).  You can invoke any command by its name using
     `M-x' (*note M-x::).

Comments
     A comment is text in a program which is intended only for the
     people reading the program, and is marked specially so that it
     will be ignored when the program is loaded or compiled.  Emacs
     offers special commands for creating, aligning, and killing
     comments.  *Note Comments::.

Compilation
     Compilation is the process of creating an executable program from
     source code.  Emacs has commands for compiling files of Emacs Lisp
     code (*note Lisp Libraries::) and programs in C and other languages
     (*note Compilation::).

Complete Key
     A complete key is a character or sequence of characters which,
     when typed by the user, fully specifies one action to be performed
     by Emacs.  For example, `X' and `Control-f' and `Control-x m' are
     keys.  Keys derive their meanings from being bound (q.v.) to
     commands (q.v.).  Thus, `X' is conventionally bound to a command
     to insert `X' in the buffer; `C-x m' is conventionally bound to a
     command to begin composing a mail message. *Note Keystrokes::.

Completion
     When Emacs automatically fills an abbreviation for a name into the
     entire name, that process is called completion.  Completion is
     done for minibuffer (q.v.) arguments when the set of possible
     valid inputs is known; for example, on command names, buffer
     names, and file names.  Completion occurs when you type <TAB>,
     <SPC>, or <RET>.  *Note Completion::.

Continuation Line
     When a line of text is longer than the width of the frame, it
     takes up more than one screen line when displayed.  We say that the
     text line is continued, and all screen lines used for it after the
     first are called continuation lines.  *Note Continuation: Basic.

Control-Character
     ASCII characters with octal codes 0 through 037, and also code
     0177, do not have graphic images assigned to them.  These are the
     control characters.  Any control character can be typed by holding
     down the <CTRL> key and typing some other character; some have
     special keys on the keyboard.  <RET>, <TAB>, <ESC>, <LFD>, and
     <DEL> are all control characters.  *Note Keystrokes::.

Copyleft
     A copyleft is a notice giving the public legal permission to
     redistribute a program or other work of art.  Copylefts are used
     by leftists to enrich the public just as copyrights are used by
     rightists to gain power over the public.

Current Buffer
     The current buffer in Emacs is the Emacs buffer on which most
     editing commands operate.  You can select any Emacs buffer as the
     current one.  *Note Buffers::.

Current Line
     The line point is on (*note Point::).

Current Paragraph
     The paragraph that point is in.  If point is between paragraphs,
     the current paragraph is the one that follows point.  *Note
     Paragraphs::.

Current Defun
     The defun (q.v.) that point is in.  If point is between defuns, the
     current defun is the one that follows point.  *Note Defuns::.

Cursor
     The cursor is the rectangle on the screen which indicates the
     position called point (q.v.) at which insertion and deletion takes
     place.  The cursor is on or under the character that follows
     point.  Often people speak of `the cursor' when, strictly
     speaking, they mean `point'.  *Note Cursor: Basic.

Customization
     Customization is making minor changes in the way Emacs works.  It
     is often done by setting variables (*note Variables::) or by
     rebinding keys (*note Keymaps::).

Default Argument
     The default for an argument is the value that is used if you do not
     specify one.  When Emacs prompts you in the minibuffer for an
     argument, the default argument is used if you just type <RET>.
     *Note Minibuffer::.

Default Directory
     When you specify a file name that does not start with `/' or `~',
     it is interpreted relative to the current buffer's default
     directory.  *Note Default Directory: Minibuffer File.

Defun
     A defun is a list at the top level of parenthesis or bracket
     structure in a program.  It is so named because most such lists in
     Lisp programs are calls to the Lisp function `defun'.  *Note
     Defuns::.

<DEL>
     The <DEL> character runs the command that deletes one character of
     text.  *Note DEL: Basic.

Deletion
     Deleting text means erasing it without saving it.  Emacs deletes
     text only when it is expected not to be worth saving (all
     whitespace, or only one character).  The alternative is killing
     (q.v.).  *Note Deletion: Killing.

Deletion of Files
     Deleting a file means removing it from the file system.  *Note
     Misc File Ops::.

Deletion of Messages
     Deleting a message means flagging it to be eliminated from your
     mail file.  Until the mail file is expunged, you can undo this by
     undeleting the message.

Deletion of Frames
     When working under the multi-frame X-based version of XEmacs, you
     can delete individual frames using the Close menu item from the
     File menu.

Deletion of Windows
     When you delete a subwindow of an Emacs frame, you eliminate it
     from the frame.  Other windows expand to use up the space.  The
     deleted window can never come back, but no actual text is lost.
     *Note Windows::.

Directory
     Files in the Unix file system are grouped into file directories.
     *Note Directories: ListDir.

Dired
     Dired is the Emacs facility that displays the contents of a file
     directory and allows you to "edit the directory", performing
     operations on the files in the directory.  *Note Dired::.

Disabled Command
     A disabled command is one that you may not run without special
     confirmation.  Commands are usually disabled because they are
     confusing for beginning users.  *Note Disabling::.

Dribble File
     A file into which Emacs writes all the characters that the user
     types on the keyboard.  Dribble files are used to make a record for
     debugging Emacs bugs.  Emacs does not make a dribble file unless
     you tell it to.  *Note Bugs::.

Echo Area
     The area at the bottom of the Emacs frame which is used for
     echoing the arguments to commands, for asking questions, and for
     printing brief messages (including error messages).  *Note Echo
     Area::.

Echoing
     Echoing refers to acknowledging the receipt of commands by
     displaying them (in the echo area).  Emacs never echoes
     single-character keys; longer keys echo only if you pause while
     typing them.

Error
     An error occurs when an Emacs command cannot execute in the current
     circumstances.  When an error occurs, execution of the command
     stops (unless the command has been programmed to do otherwise) and
     Emacs reports the error by printing an error message (q.v.).
     Type-ahead is discarded.  Then Emacs is ready to read another
     editing command.

Error Messages
     Error messages are single lines of output printed by Emacs when the
     user asks for something impossible to do (such as killing text
     forward when point is at the end of the buffer).  They appear in
     the echo area, accompanied by a beep.

<ESC>
     <ESC> is a character used as a prefix for typing Meta characters on
     keyboards lacking a <META> key.  Unlike the <META> key (which,
     like the <SHIFT> key, is held down while another character is
     typed), the <ESC> key is pressed and released, and applies to the
     next character typed.

Fill Prefix
     The fill prefix is a string that Emacs enters at the beginning of
     each line when it performs filling.  It is not regarded as part of
     the text to be filled.  *Note Filling::.

Filling
     Filling text means moving text from line to line so that all the
     lines are approximately the same length.  *Note Filling::.

Frame
     When running Emacs on a TTY terminal, "frame" means the terminal's
     screen.  When running Emacs under X, you can have multiple frames,
     each corresponding to a top-level X window and each looking like
     the screen on a TTY.  Each frame contains one or more
     non-overlapping Emacs windows (possibly with associated
     scrollbars, under X), an echo area, and (under X) possibly a
     menubar, toolbar, and/or gutter.

Global
     Global means `independent of the current environment; in effect
     throughout Emacs'.  It is the opposite of local (q.v.).  Examples
     of the use of `global' appear below.

Global Abbrev
     A global definition of an abbrev (q.v.) is effective in all major
     modes that do not have local (q.v.) definitions for the same
     abbrev.  *Note Abbrevs::.

Global Keymap
     The global keymap (q.v.) contains key bindings that are in effect
     unless local key bindings in a major mode's local keymap (q.v.)
     override them.*Note Keymaps::.

Global Substitution
     Global substitution means replacing each occurrence of one string
     by another string through a large amount of text.  *Note Replace::.

Global Variable
     The global value of a variable (q.v.) takes effect in all buffers
     that do not have their own local (q.v.) values for the variable.
     *Note Variables::.

Graphic Character
     Graphic characters are those assigned pictorial images rather than
     just names.  All the non-Meta (q.v.) characters except for the
     Control (q.v.) character are graphic characters.  These include
     letters, digits, punctuation, and spaces; they do not include
     <RET> or <ESC>.  In Emacs, typing a graphic character inserts that
     character (in ordinary editing modes).  *Note Basic Editing: Basic.

Grinding
     Grinding means adjusting the indentation in a program to fit the
     nesting structure.  *Note Grinding: Indentation.

Hardcopy
     Hardcopy means printed output.  Emacs has commands for making
     printed listings of text in Emacs buffers.  *Note Hardcopy::.

<HELP>
     You can type <HELP> at any time to ask what options you have, or
     to ask what any command does.  <HELP> is really `Control-h'.
     *Note Help::.

Inbox
     An inbox is a file in which mail is delivered by the operating
     system.  Some mail handlers transfers mail from inboxes to mail
     files (q.v.) in which the mail is then stored permanently or until
     explicitly deleted.

Indentation
     Indentation means blank space at the beginning of a line.  Most
     programming languages have conventions for using indentation to
     illuminate the structure of the program, and Emacs has special
     features to help you set up the correct indentation.  *Note
     Indentation::.

Insertion
     Insertion means copying text into the buffer, either from the
     keyboard or from some other place in Emacs.

Justification
     Justification means adding extra spaces to lines of text to make
     them come exactly to a specified width.  *Note Justification:
     Filling.

Keyboard Macros
     Keyboard macros are a way of defining new Emacs commands from
     sequences of existing ones, with no need to write a Lisp program.
     *Note Keyboard Macros::.

Key
     A key is a sequence of characters that, when input to Emacs,
     specify or begin to specify a single action for Emacs to perform.
     That is, the sequence is considered a single unit.  If the key is
     enough to specify one action, it is a complete key (q.v.); if it
     is less than enough, it is a prefix key (q.v.).  *Note
     Keystrokes::.

Keymap
     The keymap is the data structure that records the bindings (q.v.)
     of keys to the commands that they run.  For example, the keymap
     binds the character `C-n' to the command function `next-line'.
     *Note Keymaps::.

Kill Ring
     The kill ring is the place where all text you have killed recently
     is saved.  You can re-insert any of the killed text still in the
     ring; this is called yanking (q.v.).  *Note Yanking::.

Killing
     Killing means erasing text and saving it on the kill ring so it
     can be yanked (q.v.) later.  Some other systems call this
     "cutting."  Most Emacs commands to erase text do killing, as
     opposed to deletion (q.v.).  *Note Killing::.

Killing Jobs
     Killing a job (such as, an invocation of Emacs) means making it
     cease to exist.  Any data within it, if not saved in a file, is
     lost.  *Note Exiting::.

List
     A list is, approximately, a text string beginning with an open
     parenthesis and ending with the matching close parenthesis.  In C
     mode and other non-Lisp modes, groupings surrounded by other kinds
     of matched delimiters appropriate to the language, such as braces,
     are also considered lists.  Emacs has special commands for many
     operations on lists.  *Note Lists::.

Local
     Local means `in effect only in a particular context'; the relevant
     kind of context is a particular function execution, a particular
     buffer, or a particular major mode.  Local is the opposite of
     `global' (q.v.).  Specific uses of `local' in Emacs terminology
     appear below.

Local Abbrev
     A local abbrev definition is effective only if a particular major
     mode is selected.  In that major mode, it overrides any global
     definition for the same abbrev.  *Note Abbrevs::.

Local Keymap
     A local keymap is used in a particular major mode; the key bindings
     (q.v.) in the current local keymap override global bindings of the
     same keys.  *Note Keymaps::.

Local Variable
     A local value of a variable (q.v.) applies to only one buffer.
     *Note Locals::.

M-
     `M-' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for <META>, one
     of the modifier keys that can accompany any character.  *Note
     Keystrokes::.

M-C-
     `M-C-' in the name of a character is an abbreviation for
     Control-Meta; it means the same thing as `C-M-'.  If your terminal
     lacks a real <META> key, you type a Control-Meta character by
     typing <ESC> and then typing the corresponding Control character.
     *Note C-M-: Keystrokes.

M-x
     `M-x' is the key which is used to call an Emacs command by name.
     You use it to call commands that are not bound to keys.  *Note
     M-x::.

Mail
     Mail means messages sent from one user to another through the
     computer system, to be read at the recipient's convenience.  Emacs
     has commands for composing and sending mail, and for reading and
     editing the mail you have received.  *Note Sending Mail::.

Major Mode
     The major modes are a mutually exclusive set of options each of
     which configures Emacs for editing a certain sort of text.
     Ideally, each programming language has its own major mode.  *Note
     Major Modes::.

Mark
     The mark points to a position in the text.  It specifies one end
     of the region (q.v.), point being the other end.  Many commands
     operate on the whole region, that is, all the text from point to
     the mark.  *Note Mark::.

Mark Ring
     The mark ring is used to hold several recent previous locations of
     the mark, just in case you want to move back to them.  *Note Mark
     Ring::.

Message
     See `mail'.

Meta
     Meta is the name of a modifier bit which a command character may
     have.  It is present in a character if the character is typed with
     the <META> key held down.  Such characters are given names that
     start with `Meta-'.  For example, `Meta-<' is typed by holding down
     <META> and at the same time typing `<' (which itself is done, on
     most terminals, by holding down <SHIFT> and typing `,').  *Note
     Meta: Keystrokes.

Meta Character
     A Meta character is one whose character code includes the Meta bit.

Minibuffer
     The minibuffer is the window that Emacs displays inside the echo
     area (q.v.) when it prompts you for arguments to commands.  *Note
     Minibuffer::.

Minor Mode
     A minor mode is an optional feature of Emacs which can be switched
     on or off independent of the major mode.  Each minor mode has a
     command to turn it on or off.  *Note Minor Modes::.

Mode Line
     The mode line is the line at the bottom of each text window (q.v.),
     which gives status information on the buffer displayed in that
     window.  *Note Mode Line::.

Modified Buffer
     A buffer (q.v.) is modified if its text has been changed since the
     last time the buffer was saved (or since it was created, if it has
     never been saved).  *Note Saving::.

Moving Text
     Moving text means erasing it from one place and inserting it in
     another.  This is done by killing (q.v.) and then yanking (q.v.).
     *Note Killing::.

Named Mark
     A named mark is a register (q.v.) in its role of recording a
     location in text so that you can move point to that location.
     *Note Registers::.

Narrowing
     Narrowing means creating a restriction (q.v.) that limits editing
     in the current buffer to only a part of the text in the buffer.
     Text outside that part is inaccessible to the user until the
     boundaries are widened again, but it is still there, and saving
     the file saves the invisible text.  *Note Narrowing::.

Newline
     <LFD> characters in the buffer terminate lines of text and are
     called newlines.  *Note Newline: Keystrokes.

Numeric Argument
     A numeric argument is a number, specified before a command, to
     change the effect of the command.  Often the numeric argument
     serves as a repeat count.  *Note Arguments::.

Option
     An option is a variable (q.v.) that allows you to customize Emacs
     by giving it a new value.  *Note Variables::.

Overwrite Mode
     Overwrite mode is a minor mode.  When it is enabled, ordinary text
     characters replace the existing text after point rather than
     pushing it to the right.  *Note Minor Modes::.

Page
     A page is a unit of text, delimited by formfeed characters (ASCII
     Control-L, code 014) coming at the beginning of a line.  Some Emacs
     commands are provided for moving over and operating on pages.
     *Note Pages::.

Paragraphs
     Paragraphs are the medium-size unit of English text.  There are
     special Emacs commands for moving over and operating on paragraphs.
     *Note Paragraphs::.

Parsing
     We say that Emacs parses words or expressions in the text being
     edited.  Really, all it knows how to do is find the other end of a
     word or expression.  *Note Syntax::.

Point
     Point is the place in the buffer at which insertion and deletion
     occur.  Point is considered to be between two characters, not at
     one character.  The terminal's cursor (q.v.) indicates the
     location of point.  *Note Point: Basic.

Prefix Key
     A prefix key is a key (q.v.) whose sole function is to introduce a
     set of multi-character keys.  `Control-x' is an example of a prefix
     key; any two-character sequence starting with `C-x' is also a
     legitimate key.  *Note Keystrokes::.

Prompt
     A prompt is text printed to ask the user for input.  Printing a
     prompt is called prompting.  Emacs prompts always appear in the
     echo area (q.v.).  One kind of prompting happens when the
     minibuffer is used to read an argument (*note Minibuffer::); the
     echoing which happens when you pause in the middle of typing a
     multi-character key is also a kind of prompting (*note Echo
     Area::).

Quitting
     Quitting means cancelling a partially typed command or a running
     command, using `C-g'.  *Note Quitting::.

Quoting
     Quoting means depriving a character of its usual special
     significance.  In Emacs this is usually done with `Control-q'.
     What constitutes special significance depends on the context and
     on convention.  For example, an "ordinary" character as an Emacs
     command inserts itself; so in this context, a special character is
     any character that does not normally insert itself (such as <DEL>,
     for example), and quoting it makes it insert itself as if it were
     not special.  Not all contexts allow quoting.  *Note Quoting:
     Basic.

Read-only Buffer
     A read-only buffer is one whose text you are not allowed to change.
     Normally Emacs makes buffers read-only when they contain text which
     has a special significance to Emacs, such as Dired buffers.
     Visiting a file that is write-protected also makes a read-only
     buffer.  *Note Buffers::.

Recursive Editing Level
     A recursive editing level is a state in which part of the
     execution of a command involves asking the user to edit some text.
     This text may or may not be the same as the text to which the
     command was applied.  The mode line indicates recursive editing
     levels with square brackets (`[' and `]').  *Note Recursive Edit::.

Redisplay
     Redisplay is the process of correcting the image on the screen to
     correspond to changes that have been made in the text being edited.
     *Note Redisplay: Frame.

Regexp
     See `regular expression'.

Region
     The region is the text between point (q.v.) and the mark (q.v.).
     Many commands operate on the text of the region.  *Note Region:
     Mark.

Registers
     Registers are named slots in which text or buffer positions or
     rectangles can be saved for later use.  *Note Registers::.

Regular Expression
     A regular expression is a pattern that can match various text
     strings; for example, `l[0-9]+' matches `l' followed by one or more
     digits.  *Note Regexps::.

Replacement
     See `global substitution'.

Restriction
     A buffer's restriction is the amount of text, at the beginning or
     the end of the buffer, that is temporarily invisible and
     inaccessible.  Giving a buffer a nonzero amount of restriction is
     called narrowing (q.v.).  *Note Narrowing::.

<RET>
     <RET> is the character than runs the command to insert a newline
     into the text.  It is also used to terminate most arguments read
     in the minibuffer (q.v.).  *Note Return: Keystrokes.

Saving
     Saving a buffer means copying its text into the file that was
     visited (q.v.) in that buffer.  To actually change a file you have
     edited in Emacs, you have to save it.  *Note Saving::.

Scrolling
     Scrolling means shifting the text in the Emacs window to make a
     different part of the buffer visible.  *Note Scrolling: Display.

Searching
     Searching means moving point to the next occurrence of a specified
     string.  *Note Search::.

Selecting
     Selecting a buffer means making it the current (q.v.) buffer.
     *Note Selecting: Buffers.

Self-documentation
     Self-documentation is the feature of Emacs which can tell you what
     any command does, or can give you a list of all commands related
     to a topic you specify.  You ask for self-documentation with the
     help character, `C-h'.  *Note Help::.

Sentences
     Emacs has commands for moving by or killing by sentences.  *Note
     Sentences::.

Sexp
     An sexp (short for `s-expression,' itself short for `symbolic
     expression') is the basic syntactic unit of Lisp in its textual
     form: either a list, or Lisp atom.  Many Emacs commands operate on
     sexps.  The term `sexp' is generalized to languages other than
     Lisp to mean a syntactically recognizable expression.  *Note
     Sexps: Lists.

Simultaneous Editing
     Simultaneous editing means two users modifying the same file at
     once.  If simultaneous editing is not detected, you may lose your
     work.  Emacs detects all cases of simultaneous editing and warns
     the user to investigate them.  *Note Simultaneous Editing:
     Interlocking.

String
     A string is a kind of Lisp data object which contains a sequence of
     characters.  Many Emacs variables are intended to have strings as
     values.  The Lisp syntax for a string consists of the characters in
     the string with a `"' before and another `"' after. Write a `"'
     that is part of the string as `\"' and a `\' that is part of the
     string as `\\'.  You can include all other characters, including
     newline, just by writing them inside the string. You can also
     include escape sequences as in C, such as `\n' for newline or
     `\241' using an octal character code.

String Substitution
     See `global substitution'.

Syntax Table
     The syntax table tells Emacs which characters are part of a word,
     which characters balance each other like parentheses, etc.  *Note
     Syntax::.

Tag Table
     A tag table is a file that serves as an index to the function
     definitions in one or more other files.  *Note Tags::.

Termscript File
     A termscript file contains a record of all characters Emacs sent to
     the terminal.  It is used for tracking down bugs in Emacs
     redisplay.  Emacs does not make a termscript file unless
     explicitly instructed to do so.  *Note Bugs::.

Text
     Text has two meanings (*note Text::):

        * Data consisting of a sequence of characters, as opposed to
          binary numbers, images, graphics commands, executable
          programs, and the like.  The contents of an Emacs buffer are
          always text in this sense.

        * Data consisting of written human language, as opposed to
          programs, or something that follows the stylistic conventions
          of human language.

Top Level
     Top level is the normal state of Emacs, in which you are editing
     the text of the file you have visited.  You are at top level
     whenever you are not in a recursive editing level (q.v.) or the
     minibuffer (q.v.), and not in the middle of a command.  You can
     get back to top level by aborting (q.v.) and quitting (q.v.).
     *Note Quitting::.

Transposition
     Transposing two units of text means putting each one into the place
     formerly occupied by the other.  There are Emacs commands to
     transpose two adjacent characters, words, sexps (q.v.), or lines
     (*note Transpose::).

Truncation
     Truncating text lines in the display means leaving out any text on
     a line that does not fit within the right margin of the window
     displaying it.  See also `continuation line'.  *Note Truncation:
     Basic.

Undoing
     Undoing means making your previous editing go in reverse, bringing
     back the text that existed earlier in the editing session.  *Note
     Undo::.

Variable
     A variable is Lisp object that can store an arbitrary value.
     Emacs uses some variables for internal purposes, and has others
     (known as `options' (q.v.)) you can set to control the behavior of
     Emacs.  The variables used in Emacs that you are likely to be
     interested in are listed in the Variables Index of this manual.
     *Note Variables::, for information on variables.

Visiting
     Visiting a file means loading its contents into a buffer (q.v.)
     where they can be edited.  *Note Visiting::.

Whitespace
     Whitespace is any run of consecutive formatting characters (spaces,
     tabs, newlines, and backspaces).

Widening
     Widening is removing any restriction (q.v.) on the current buffer;
     it is the opposite of narrowing (q.v.).  *Note Narrowing::.

Window
     Emacs divides the frame into one or more windows, each of which can
     display the contents of one buffer (q.v.) at any time.  *Note
     Frame::, for basic information on how Emacs uses the frame.  *Note
     Windows::, for commands to control the use of windows. Note that if
     you are running Emacs under X, terminology can be confusing: Each
     Emacs frame occupies a separate X window and can, in turn, be
     divided into different subwindows.

Word Abbrev
     Synonymous with `abbrev'.

Word Search
     Word search is searching for a sequence of words, considering the
     punctuation between them as insignificant.  *Note Word Search::.

Yanking
     Yanking means reinserting text previously killed.  It can be used
     to undo a mistaken kill, or for copying or moving text.  Some other
     systems call this "pasting".  *Note Yanking::.

The GNU Manifesto
*****************

What's GNU?  GNU's Not Unix!
============================

GNU, which stands for GNU's Not Unix, is the name for the complete
Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it
away free to everyone who can use it.  Several other volunteers are
helping me.  Contributions of time, money, programs, and equipment are
greatly needed.

   So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor
commands, a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator,
a linker, and around 35 utilities.  A shell (command interpreter) is
nearly completed.  A new portable optimizing C compiler has compiled
itself and may be released this year.  An initial kernel exists, but
many more features are needed to emulate Unix.  When the kernel and
compiler are finished, it will be possible to distribute a GNU system
suitable for program development.  We will use TeX as our text
formatter, but an nroff is being worked on.  We will use the free,
portable X window system as well.  After this we will add a portable
Common Lisp, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other
things, plus online documentation.  We hope to supply, eventually,
everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system, and more.

   GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to
Unix.  We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our
experience with other operating systems.  In particular, we plan to
have longer filenames, file version numbers, a crashproof file system,
filename completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and
perhaps eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several
Lisp programs and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen.  Both C
and Lisp will be available as system programming languages.  We will
try to support UUCP, MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for
communication.

   GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000/16000 class with
virtual memory, because they are the easiest machines to make it run
on.  The extra effort to make it run on smaller machines will be left
to someone who wants to use it on them.

   To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the `G' in the word
`GNU' when it is the name of this project.

Why I Must Write GNU
====================

I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must
share it with other people who like it.  Software sellers want to divide
the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with
others.  I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way.  I
cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software
license agreement.  For years I worked within the Artificial
Intelligence Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities,
but eventually they had gone too far: I could not remain in an
institution where such things are done for me against my will.

   So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have
decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that I
will be able to get along without any software that is not free.  I
have resigned from the AI lab to deny MIT any legal excuse to prevent
me from giving GNU away.

Why GNU Will Be Compatible With Unix
====================================

Unix is not my ideal system, but it is not too bad.  The essential
features of Unix seem to be good ones, and I think I can fill in what
Unix lacks without spoiling them.  And a system compatible with Unix
would be convenient for many other people to adopt.

How GNU Will Be Available
=========================

GNU is not in the public domain.  Everyone will be permitted to modify
and redistribute GNU, but no distributor will be allowed to restrict its
further redistribution.  That is to say, proprietary modifications will
not be allowed.  I want to make sure that all versions of GNU remain
free.

Why Many Other Programmers Want to Help
=======================================

I have found many other programmers who are excited about GNU and want
to help.

   Many programmers are unhappy about the commercialization of system
software.  It may enable them to make more money, but it requires them
to feel in conflict with other programmers in general rather than feel
as comrades.  The fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the
sharing of programs; marketing arrangements now typically used
essentially forbid programmers to treat others as friends.  The
purchaser of software must choose between friendship and obeying the
law.  Naturally, many decide that friendship is more important.  But
those who believe in law often do not feel at ease with either choice.
They become cynical and think that programming is just a way of making
money.

   By working on and using GNU rather than proprietary programs, we can
be hospitable to everyone and obey the law.  In addition, GNU serves as
an example to inspire and a banner to rally others to join us in
sharing.  This can give us a feeling of harmony which is impossible if
we use software that is not free.  For about half the programmers I
talk to, this is an important happiness that money cannot replace.

How You Can Contribute
======================

I am asking computer manufacturers for donations of machines and money.
I'm asking individuals for donations of programs and work.

   One consequence you can expect if you donate machines is that GNU
will run on them at an early date.  The machines should be complete,
ready-to-use systems, approved for use in a residential area, and not
in need of sophisticated cooling or power.

   I have found very many programmers eager to contribute part-time
work for GNU.  For most projects, such part-time distributed work would
be very hard to coordinate; the independently-written parts would not
work together.  But for the particular task of replacing Unix, this
problem is absent.  A complete Unix system contains hundreds of utility
programs, each of which is documented separately.  Most interface
specifications are fixed by Unix compatibility.  If each contributor
can write a compatible replacement for a single Unix utility, and make
it work properly in place of the original on a Unix system, then these
utilities will work right when put together.  Even allowing for Murphy
to create a few unexpected problems, assembling these components will
be a feasible task.  (The kernel will require closer communication and
will be worked on by a small, tight group.)

   If I get donations of money, I may be able to hire a few people full
or part time.  The salary won't be high by programmers' standards, but
I'm looking for people for whom building community spirit is as
important as making money.  I view this as a way of enabling dedicated
people to devote their full energies to working on GNU by sparing them
the need to make a living in another way.

Why All Computer Users Will Benefit
===================================

Once GNU is written, everyone will be able to obtain good system
software free, just like air.

   This means much more than just saving everyone the price of a Unix
license.  It means that much wasteful duplication of system programming
effort will be avoided.  This effort can go instead into advancing the
state of the art.

   Complete system sources will be available to everyone.  As a result,
a user who needs changes in the system will always be free to make them
himself, or hire any available programmer or company to make them for
him.  Users will no longer be at the mercy of one programmer or company
which owns the sources and is in sole position to make changes.

   Schools will be able to provide a much more educational environment
by encouraging all students to study and improve the system code.
Harvard's computer lab used to have the policy that no program could be
installed on the system if its sources were not on public display, and
upheld it by actually refusing to install certain programs.  I was very
much inspired by this.

   Finally, the overhead of considering who owns the system software
and what one is or is not entitled to do with it will be lifted.

   Arrangements to make people pay for using a program, including
licensing of copies, always incur a tremendous cost to society through
the cumbersome mechanisms necessary to figure out how much (that is,
which programs) a person must pay for.  And only a police state can
force everyone to obey them.  Consider a space station where air must
be manufactured at great cost: charging each breather per liter of air
may be fair, but wearing the metered gas mask all day and all night is
intolerable even if everyone can afford to pay the air bill.  And the
TV cameras everywhere to see if you ever take the mask off are
outrageous.  It's better to support the air plant with a head tax and
chuck the masks.

   Copying all or parts of a program is as natural to a programmer as
breathing, and as productive.  It ought to be as free.

Some Easily Rebutted Objections to GNU's Goals
==============================================

     "Nobody will use it if it is free, because that means they can't
     rely on any support."

     "You have to charge for the program to pay for providing the
     support."

   If people would rather pay for GNU plus service than get GNU free
without service, a company to provide just service to people who have
obtained GNU free ought to be profitable.

   We must distinguish between support in the form of real programming
work and mere handholding.  The former is something one cannot rely on
from a software vendor.  If your problem is not shared by enough
people, the vendor will tell you to get lost.

   If your business needs to be able to rely on support, the only way
is to have all the necessary sources and tools.  Then you can hire any
available person to fix your problem; you are not at the mercy of any
individual.  With Unix, the price of sources puts this out of
consideration for most businesses.  With GNU this will be easy.  It is
still possible for there to be no available competent person, but this
problem cannot be blamed on distribution arrangements.  GNU does not
eliminate all the world's problems, only some of them.

   Meanwhile, the users who know nothing about computers need
handholding: doing things for them which they could easily do
themselves but don't know how.

   Such services could be provided by companies that sell just
hand-holding and repair service.  If it is true that users would rather
spend money and get a product with service, they will also be willing
to buy the service having got the product free.  The service companies
will compete in quality and price; users will not be tied to any
particular one.  Meanwhile, those of us who don't need the service
should be able to use the program without paying for the service.

     "You cannot reach many people without advertising, and you must
     charge for the program to support that."

     "It's no use advertising a program people can get free."

   There are various forms of free or very cheap publicity that can be
used to inform numbers of computer users about something like GNU.  But
it may be true that one can reach more microcomputer users with
advertising.  If this is really so, a business which advertises the
service of copying and mailing GNU for a fee ought to be successful
enough to pay for its advertising and more.  This way, only the users
who benefit from the advertising pay for it.

   On the other hand, if many people get GNU from their friends, and
such companies don't succeed, this will show that advertising was not
really necessary to spread GNU.  Why is it that free market advocates
don't want to let the free market decide this?

     "My company needs a proprietary operating system to get a
     competitive edge."

   GNU will remove operating system software from the realm of
competition.  You will not be able to get an edge in this area, but
neither will your competitors be able to get an edge over you.  You and
they will compete in other areas, while benefitting mutually in this
one.  If your business is selling an operating system, you will not
like GNU, but that's tough on you.  If your business is something else,
GNU can save you from being pushed into the expensive business of
selling operating systems.

   I would like to see GNU development supported by gifts from many
manufacturers and users, reducing the cost to each.

     "Don't programmers deserve a reward for their creativity?"

   If anything deserves a reward, it is social contribution.
Creativity can be a social contribution, but only in so far as society
is free to use the results.  If programmers deserve to be rewarded for
creating innovative programs, by the same token they deserve to be
punished if they restrict the use of these programs.

     "Shouldn't a programmer be able to ask for a reward for his
     creativity?"

   There is nothing wrong with wanting pay for work, or seeking to
maximize one's income, as long as one does not use means that are
destructive.  But the means customary in the field of software today
are based on destruction.

   Extracting money from users of a program by restricting their use of
it is destructive because the restrictions reduce the amount and the
ways that the program can be used.  This reduces the amount of wealth
that humanity derives from the program.  When there is a deliberate
choice to restrict, the harmful consequences are deliberate destruction.

   The reason a good citizen does not use such destructive means to
become wealthier is that, if everyone did so, we would all become
poorer from the mutual destructiveness.  This is Kantian ethics; or,
the Golden Rule.  Since I do not like the consequences that result if
everyone hoards information, I am required to consider it wrong for one
to do so.  Specifically, the desire to be rewarded for one's creativity
does not justify depriving the world in general of all or part of that
creativity.

     "Won't programmers starve?"

   I could answer that nobody is forced to be a programmer.  Most of us
cannot manage to get any money for standing on the street and making
faces.  But we are not, as a result, condemned to spend our lives
standing on the street making faces, and starving.  We do something
else.

   But that is the wrong answer because it accepts the questioner's
implicit assumption: that without ownership of software, programmers
cannot possibly be paid a cent.  Supposedly it is all or nothing.

   The real reason programmers will not starve is that it will still be
possible for them to get paid for programming; just not paid as much as
now.

   Restricting copying is not the only basis for business in software.
It is the most common basis because it brings in the most money.  If it
were prohibited, or rejected by the customer, software business would
move to other bases of organization which are now used less often.
There are always numerous ways to organize any kind of business.

   Probably programming will not be as lucrative on the new basis as it
is now.  But that is not an argument against the change.  It is not
considered an injustice that sales clerks make the salaries that they
now do.  If programmers made the same, that would not be an injustice
either.  (In practice they would still make considerably more than
that.)

     "Don't people have a right to control how their creativity is
     used?"

   "Control over the use of one's ideas" really constitutes control over
other people's lives; and it is usually used to make their lives more
difficult.

   People who have studied the issue of intellectual property rights
carefully (such as lawyers) say that there is no intrinsic right to
intellectual property.  The kinds of supposed intellectual property
rights that the government recognizes were created by specific acts of
legislation for specific purposes.

   For example, the patent system was established to encourage
inventors to disclose the details of their inventions.  Its purpose was
to help society rather than to help inventors.  At the time, the life
span of 17 years for a patent was short compared with the rate of
advance of the state of the art.  Since patents are an issue only among
manufacturers, for whom the cost and effort of a license agreement are
small compared with setting up production, the patents often do not do
much harm.  They do not obstruct most individuals who use patented
products.

   The idea of copyright did not exist in ancient times, when authors
frequently copied other authors at length in works of non-fiction.  This
practice was useful, and is the only way many authors' works have
survived even in part.  The copyright system was created expressly for
the purpose of encouraging authorship.  In the domain for which it was
invented--books, which could be copied economically only on a printing
press--it did little harm, and did not obstruct most of the individuals
who read the books.

   All intellectual property rights are just licenses granted by society
because it was thought, rightly or wrongly, that society as a whole
would benefit by granting them.  But in any particular situation, we
have to ask: are we really better off granting such license?  What kind
of act are we licensing a person to do?

   The case of programs today is very different from that of books a
hundred years ago.  The fact that the easiest way to copy a program is
from one neighbor to another, the fact that a program has both source
code and object code which are distinct, and the fact that a program is
used rather than read and enjoyed, combine to create a situation in
which a person who enforces a copyright is harming society as a whole
both materially and spiritually; in which a person should not do so
regardless of whether the law enables him to.

     "Competition makes things get done better."

   The paradigm of competition is a race: by rewarding the winner, we
encourage everyone to run faster.  When capitalism really works this
way, it does a good job; but its defenders are wrong in assuming it
always works this way.  If the runners forget why the reward is offered
and become intent on winning, no matter how, they may find other
strategies--such as, attacking other runners.  If the runners get into
a fist fight, they will all finish late.

   Proprietary and secret software is the moral equivalent of runners
in a fist fight.  Sad to say, the only referee we've got does not seem
to object to fights; he just regulates them ("For every ten yards you
run, you can fire one shot").  He really ought to break them up, and
penalize runners for even trying to fight.

     "Won't everyone stop programming without a monetary incentive?"

   Actually, many people will program with absolutely no monetary
incentive.  Programming has an irresistible fascination for some
people, usually the people who are best at it.  There is no shortage of
professional musicians who keep at it even though they have no hope of
making a living that way.

   But really this question, though commonly asked, is not appropriate
to the situation.  Pay for programmers will not disappear, only become
less.  So the right question is, will anyone program with a reduced
monetary incentive?  My experience shows that they will.

   For more than ten years, many of the world's best programmers worked
at the Artificial Intelligence Lab for far less money than they could
have had anywhere else.  They got many kinds of non-monetary rewards:
fame and appreciation, for example.  And creativity is also fun, a
reward in itself.

   Then most of them left when offered a chance to do the same
interesting work for a lot of money.

   What the facts show is that people will program for reasons other
than riches; but if given a chance to make a lot of money as well, they
will come to expect and demand it.  Low-paying organizations do poorly
in competition with high-paying ones, but they do not have to do badly
if the high-paying ones are banned.

     "We need the programmers desperately.  If they demand that we stop
     helping our neighbors, we have to obey."

   You're never so desperate that you have to obey this sort of demand.
Remember: millions for defense, but not a cent for tribute!

     "Programmers need to make a living somehow."

   In the short run, this is true.  However, there are plenty of ways
that programmers could make a living without selling the right to use a
program.  This way is customary now because it brings programmers and
businessmen the most money, not because it is the only way to make a
living.  It is easy to find other ways if you want to find them.  Here
are a number of examples.

   A manufacturer introducing a new computer will pay for the porting of
operating systems onto the new hardware.

   The sale of teaching, hand-holding, and maintenance services could
also employ programmers.

   People with new ideas could distribute programs as freeware and ask
for donations from satisfied users or sell hand-holding services.  I
have met people who are already working this way successfully.

   Users with related needs can form users' groups and pay dues.  A
group would contract with programming companies to write programs that
the group's members would like to use.

   All sorts of development can be funded with a Software Tax:

     Suppose everyone who buys a computer has to pay a certain percent
     of the price as a software tax.  The government gives this to an
     agency like the NSF to spend on software development.

     But if the computer buyer makes a donation to software development
     himself, he can take a credit against the tax.  He can donate to
     the project of his own choosing--often, chosen because he hopes to
     use the results when

     it is done.  He can take a credit for any amount of donation up to
     the total tax he had to pay.

     The total tax rate could be decided by a vote of the payers of the
     tax, weighted according to the amount they will be taxed on.

     The consequences:

        * The computer-using community supports software development.

        * This community decides what level of support is needed.

        * Users who care which projects their share is spent on can
          choose this for themselves.

   In the long run, making programs free is a step toward the
post-scarcity world, where nobody will have to work very hard just to
make a living.  People will be free to devote themselves to activities
that are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten
hours a week on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling,
robot repair, and asteroid prospecting.  There will be no need to be
able to make a living from programming.

   We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole
society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this
has translated itself into leisure for workers because much
nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity.
The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles against
competition.  Free software will greatly reduce these drains in the
area of software production.  We must do this, in order for technical
gains in productivity to translate into less work for us.
