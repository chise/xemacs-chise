Introduction
************

You are reading about XEmacs which is a self-documenting, customizable,
extensible real-time display editor.

   XEmacs is a "display" editor because normally the text being edited
is visible on the screen and is updated automatically as you type.
*Note Display: (xemacs)Frame.

   It is a "real-time" editor because the display is updated very
frequently, usually after each character or pair of characters you type.
This minimizes the amount of information you must keep in your head as
you edit.  *Note Real-time: (xemacs)Basic.

   It is advanced because it provides facilities that go beyond simple
insertion and deletion: filling of text; automatic indentation of
programs; viewing two or more files at once; and dealing in terms of
characters, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as
expressions and comments in several different programming languages.
It is much easier to type one command meaning "go to the end of the
paragraph" than to find that spot with simple cursor keys.

   "Self-documenting" means that at any time you can type a special
character, `Control-h', to find out what your options are.  You can
also use `C-h' to find out what a command does, or to find all the
commands relevant to a topic.  *Note Help: (xemacs)Help.

   "Customizable" means you can change the definitions of Emacs
commands.  For example, if you use a programming language in which
comments start with `<**' and end with `**>', you can tell the Emacs
comment manipulation commands to use those strings (*note Comments:
(xemacs)Comments.).  Another sort of customization is rearrangement of
the command set.  For example, you can set up the four basic cursor
motion commands (up, down, left and right) on keys in a diamond pattern
on the keyboard if you prefer.  *Note Customization:
(xemacs)Customization.

   "Extensible" means you can go beyond simple customization and write
entirely new commands, programs in the Lisp language to be run by
Emacs's own Lisp interpreter.  Emacs is an "on-line extensible" system:
it is divided into many functions that call each other.  You can
redefine any function in the middle of an editing session and replace
any part of Emacs without making a separate copy of all of Emacs.  Most
of the editing commands of Emacs are written in Lisp; the few
exceptions could have been written in Lisp but are written in C for
efficiency.  Only a programmer can write an extension to Emacs, but
anybody can use it afterward.

Entering and Exiting Emacs
**************************

While using Emacs you should be familiar with the following three terms:

Buffer
     A buffer is a region of memory holding characters. It is the basic
     editing unit; one buffer corresponds to one piece of text being
     edited. You can have multiple buffers but you can edit only one
     buffer at any one time. For more information, *Note Buffers:
     (xemacs)Buffers.

File
     A file is a region of disk space holding characters. Emacs edits a
     file by reading it into a buffer, editing that buffer and writing
     out the buffer back to the file. To save your work permanently you
     have to write it to a file.  So after you load and work with a
     file, you have to save it back.

Windows
     A window is a rectangular region in which a buffer is displayed.
     You can open multiple windows with multiple buffers and edit them
     by selecting the corresponding buffer. Initially, when you start
     emacs, it will automatically open up a window for you.

* Menu:

* Enter::                       Entering Emacs from the shell
* Frame::                      Basic information about the XEmacs Frame
* Exiting::                     Exiting Emacs
* Mode Line::                   Interpreting the mode line.
* Echo Area::                   Bottom of the frame where you interact
                                with Emacs.

Entering Emacs
==============

To enter Emacs type `xemacs' and press the Return key at the shell i.e.
`xemacs <RET>'.  This will bring up an emacs window with `*scratch*' as
the default buffer because Emacs must always have a buffer to work on.
Then choose the Open... option from the File menu on the menubar at the
top of the frame. It will prompt you to enter a filename. After you
enter the filename, Emacs will read that file into the current buffer.
You can also type :
     xemacs <filename> <RET>
   directly which will bring up an Emacs frame with the "filename" as
the buffer.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Frame,  Next: Exiting,  Prev: Enter,  Up: Entering

Emacs Frame
===========

When you run XEmacs under X, a menu bar on top of the Emacs frame
provides access to pull-down menus of file, edit, and help-related
commands. The menus only provide convenient shortcuts, the options that
they provide are available via key commands. You can invoke those
commands from the keyboard also. For many of the options, their
corresponding key commands are displayed right besides them. The five
default menus on the menubar that you will see on the frame are File,
Edit, Options, Buffers and Help. *Note XEmacs Pull-down Menus:
(xemacs)XEmacs Pull-down Menus, for detailed information on the
functions provided by the pull-down menus.

   The Emacs frame has a rectangle shaped box at the extreme right and
you can drag it up or down to scroll the window accordingly. Clicking
on the arrows also serves the same purpose.

   The last line in your window is `the Mode line' which will give you
a description of what's going on in that particular window. *Note Mode
Line::, for more information. Below the mode line is the `Echo area'.
Emacs uses this area to interact with the user. *Note Echo Area::.

   If you wish to open another file in a new window after you enter
XEmacs, select Open in New Frame... from the File menu, which will
prompt you for a filename and open a new window with that filename as
the current buffer. If you want to open a new file in the same window,
select Open.. from the File menu. You need to enter XEmacs only once,
you can edit multiple files by opening several other frames or by
switching between buffers.

Exiting Emacs
=============

There are two commands for exiting Emacs, one for "suspending" Emacs
and the other for "killing" Emacs. "Suspending" means stopping Emacs
temporarily and returning control to the shell, allowing you to resume
editing later in the same Emacs job, with the same files, same kill
ring, same undo history, and so on.  This is the usual way to exit.
"Killing" Emacs means destroying the Emacs job.  You can run Emacs
again later, but you will get a fresh Emacs; there is no way to resume
the same editing session after it has been killed.

`C-z'
     Suspend Emacs (`suspend-emacs').  If used under the X window
     system, this command will shrink the X window containing the Emacs
     frame to an icon. Clicking on the icon will resume that Emacs
     process again. *Note Exiting Emacs: (xemacs)Exiting Emacs.

`C-x C-c'
     Kill Emacs (`save-buffers-kill-emacs'). You can also select Exit
     Emacs option from the File menu to kill that Emacs process. If you
     haven't saved the file, Emacs will ask you if you wish to save the
     file before killing that process.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Mode Line,  Next: Echo Area,  Prev: Exiting,  Up: Entering

The Mode Line
=============

When you enter XEmacs, each text window's last line is a "mode line"
which describes what is going on in that window. Normally, the mode
line looks like :

     --CH-XEmacs: BUF     (MAJOR MINOR)----POS------

This gives information about the buffer being displayed in the window:
the buffer's name, what major and minor modes are in use, whether the
buffer's text has been changed, and how far down the buffer you are
currently looking.

   The CH contains :
`**'
     if the text in the buffer has been edited

`--'
     if the text in the buffer has not been edited

`%%'
     if the buffer is a read-only-buffer i.e. it cannot be edited

   BUF is the name of the window's chosen "buffer". If you are editing
a file (which is the selected buffer), the file name appears in BUF.
*Note Buffers: (xemacs)Buffers.

   POS contains :
`All'
     if your entire file is visible on the screen.

`Top'
     if you are looking at the beginning of the file.

`Bot'
     if you are looking at the end of the file.

`NN%'
     NN will be a number corresponding to the percentage of the file
     above the top of the screen, for example `52', which means that 52%
     of the file is above the top of the screen.

   MAJOR is the name of the "major mode" in effect in the buffer.  At
any time, each buffer is in one and only one major mode.  The available
major modes include Fundamental mode (the least specialized), Text
mode, Lisp mode, and C mode.  *Note Major Modes: (xemacs)Major Modes,
for details on how the modes differ and how you select one.

   MINOR is a list of some of the "minor modes" that are turned on in
the window's chosen buffer.  For example, `Fill' means that Auto Fill
mode is on which means that lines are broken automatically when they
become too wide. *Note Minor Modes: (xemacs)Minor Modes, for more
information on various minor modes and how to enable them.

   You can also display time in the mode line. *Note The Mode Line:
(xemacs)The Mode Line, for more information regarding the mode line.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Echo Area,  Prev: Mode Line,  Up: Entering

The Echo Area
=============

The line at the bottom of the frame (below the mode line) is the "echo
area".  Emacs uses this area to communicate with you:

   *   The "echo area" will print out the characters that you type. For
     example, if you choose the Open... option from the File menu you
     might get the following in the echo area:

          Find file: /usr/lib/x11/

     Now you need to give a file name to open, for example if the file
     name is `myfile', you will type `myfile' after `/usr/lib/x11/' and
     press the <Return> key. If you pause for more than a second while
     typing, you will see the characters that you type in the "echo
     area".

   *   The "echo area" also prints error messages. For example, if you
     misspell `usr' and type `/urs/lib/x11/myfile' <RETURN> in the
     above example you might get an error message. Since Emacs will not
     be able to find the `/urs' directory, the "echo area" will say:

          error--> Opening directory: no such file or directory, /urs/lib/x11/myfile

     This error message will be accompanied by a beep. Some XEmacs
     commands will print informative messages in the "echo area". *Note
     The Echo Area: (xemacs)The Echo Area, for more information on the
     "echo area".

XEmacs Windows
==============

When you use XEmacs under X, you can open multiple windows and each
window can display one buffer or multiple parts of one buffer. Each
window will have its own "mode line" and "echo area". At any one time
there is only one "selected window" and the buffer it displays is the
"selected buffer". There are some commands for manipulating windows:

`M-C-v'
     This command will scroll the window which is not "selected"
     (`scroll-other-window').

`C-x 0'
     This command will get rid of the selected window (`delete-window').
     That is a zero. If there is more than one Emacs frame, deleting the
     sole remaining window on that frame deletes the frame as well. If
     the current frame is the only frame, it is not deleted.

`C-x 1'
     This command will get rid of all the windows except the selected
     one.  (`delete-other-windows'). For example, if you use the
     Describe variable option from the Help menu, the window will split
     vertically and the bottom window will contain documentation for
     that variable. After you are done looking at that variable's
     documentation you might want to come back to your original single
     window. Just type `C-x 1' after your cursor is in the top window
     (the window which you want to keep) and hit <RET>.

`C-x 2'
     This command will split the selected window into two windows, one
     above the other (`split-window-vertically'). Both the windows will
     start out by displaying the same buffer. The window in which you
     have your cursor will be your "selected window".

`C-x 3'
     This will split the selected window into two windows positioned
     side by side (`split-window-horizontally'). A line of vertical
     bars will separate the window.

You can select a buffer in another window by using some other commands.
These commands all have a prefix key `C-x 4'
`C-x 4 b BUFNAME <RET>'
     This command will select a buffer BUFNAME in another window.  This
     runs `switch-to-buffer-other-window'. It will prompt you for a
     buffername.

`C-x 4 f FILENAME <RET>'
     Visit file FILENAME and select its buffer in another window.  This
     runs `find-file-other-window'.  *Note Visiting: (xemacs)Visiting.
     It will prompt you for a filename.

`C-x 4 d DIRECTORY <RET>'
     Select a Dired buffer for directory DIRECTORY in another window.
     This runs `dired-other-window'.  *Note Dired: (xemacs)Dired.

`C-x 4 m'
     Start composing a mail message in another window.  This runs
     `mail-other-window', and its same-window version is `C-x m'.
     *Note Sending Mail: (xemacs)Sending Mail, for information on how
     to Send Mail using XEmacs. *Note Reading Mail With Rmail:
     (xemacs)Reading Mail With Rmail, for information on reading mail
     using Rmail.

   If you click the right button on the mouse on a mode line, you will
get a menu with following options:
Delete Window
     Choosing this menu will remove the window above this modeline from
     the frame.

Delete Other Windows
     Delete all windows on the frame except for the one above this
     modeline.

Split Window
     Split the window above the mode line in half, creating another
     window.

Split Window Horizontally
     Split the window above the mode line in half horizontally, so that
     there will be two windows side-by-side.

Balance Windows
     Readjust the sizes of all windows on the frame until all windows
     have roughly the same number of lines.

XEmacs Pull-down Menus
======================

When you run XEmacs under X, each Emacs frame has a menu-bar at the top
which provides commands for editing, help and other options. All these
options are also available via key commands, the menus just provide
convenient short-cuts. The key commands are displayed right besides
some of the options. The following is a brief description of the four
default menus on the menu bar:

* Menu:

* File menu::                   Items on the File menu
* Edit menu::                   Items on the Edit menu
* Options Menu::                Items on the Options Menu
* Buffers Menu::                Items on the Buffers Menu
* Help menu::                   The Help Menu at the extreme right on
                                the frame


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: File menu,  Next: Edit menu,  Prev: Pull-down Menus,  Up: Pull-down Menus

The File Menu
-------------

The File menu bar contains the following items. To choose a particular
option, press the left mouse button and drag it to the item you wish to
select. Then release the button.

Open...
     This option will prompt you for a file name. You will get a
     message in the echo area:

          Find File:

     After Find File, there might be a directory path also. After you
     type the file name and press <RET> the file will be loaded into a
     new buffer.

Open in New Frame...
     It prompts you for a file name and loads that file in a new buffer
     in a new frame. You can open many frames for the same Emacs
     session. You can delete the frame by selecting Delete Frame.

Insert File...
     Prompts you for a filename and inserts the contents of this
     filename in your current buffer. Position your cursor at the place
     you wish to insert the file and select this option. You will get
     the following message in the echo area:

          Insert file:

     Insert the file name and press <RET>.

Save <Buffername>
     It saves the changes you have made to the buffer. If you have made
     changes which are not saved yet, the option will appear dark,
     otherwise it will be light and unselectable. If you do not wish to
     save the changes, select Revert Buffer.

Save As...
     Prompts you for a filename and saves the current buffer in that
     file. It loads the new file if the filename you specify is
     different from the one you were working with.

Print Buffer <buffername>
     Prints a hardcopy of the current or "selected" buffer.

New Frame
     Opens a new frame with *scratch* as the default buffer. It doesn't
     prompt you for a filename. To open a file you need to go to that
     frame and select Open...

Split Frame
     Splits the current window into two equal-sized windows with the
     same buffer. To get back a single frame, select Un-Split (Keep
     This). *Note XEmacs Window::, for more information about windows.

Un-Split (Keep This)
     If the frame contains multiple windows, it will remove all windows
     except the selected one.

Un-Split (Keep Others)
     If the frame contains multiple windows, it will remove the selected
     window and keep the other one.

Revert Buffer <buffername>
     If you do not wish to save the changes you made to the file since
     you opened it, select this option. It will restore the last saved
     version of the file to the current buffer.

Kill Buffer <buffername>
     It will kill the current buffer. If will prompt you if there are
     unsaved changes.

Exit Emacs
     It will kill the Emacs "process" as opposed to simply killing the
     "buffer". Before it kills the process, it will prompt you as to
     which unsaved buffers you wish to save by going through the list
     of the buffers.

The Edit Menu
-------------

Most of the commands in this menu work on a block of text or a selected
region. The text will be highlighted as you select it.
Undo
     Undoes the previous command.  If you type something by mistake you
     can use this command. For example, if you select Insert File...
     from the File menu and insert a wrong file by mistake, you can
     select this item and it will remove the inserted file. It undoes a
     batch of text which is worth an emacs command.

Cut
     Removes the selected text block from the current buffer, makes it
     the X clipboard selection, and places it in the kill ring (*note
     Moving Text::). Before executing this command, you have to select
     a region using Emacs region selection commands or with the mouse.
     *Note Selecting Text::.

Copy
     Makes a selected text block the X clipboard selection, and places
     it in the kill ring.  You can select text using one of the Emacs
     region selection commands or by selecting a text region with the
     mouse. *Note Selecting Text::, for more information.

Paste
     Inserts the current value of the X clipboard selection in the
     current buffer.  Note that this is not necessarily the same as the
     Emacs `yank' command, because the Emacs kill ring and the X
     clipboard selection are not the same thing.  You can paste in text
     you have placed in the clipboard using Copy or Cut.  You can also
     use Paste to insert text that was pasted into the clipboard from
     other applications. *Note X Clipboard Selection: (xemacs)X
     Clipboard Selection, for information on using Clipboard Selection.

Clear
     Removes the selected text block from the current buffer but does
     not place it in the kill ring or the X clipboard selection. You
     will not be able to get this text back.

Start Macro Recording
     After selecting this, Emacs will remember every keystroke you type
     until End Macro Recording is selected.

End Macro Recording
     Selecting this tells emacs to stop remembering your keystrokes.

Execute Last Macro
     Selecting this item will cause emacs to re-interpret all of the
     keystrokes which were saved between selections of the Start Macro
     Recording and End Macro Recording menu items.  You can now execute
     the most recent keyboard macro. *Note Keyboard Macros:

File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Options Menu,  Next: Buffers Menu,  Prev: Edit menu,  Up: Pull-down Menus

The Options Menu
----------------

There are sub-menus for some of the menus which you will need to
select. If sub-menus exist for an item, they will be displayed
automatically when you drag the mouse on that item. The items in this
menu provide some fancy editing operations.

Read Only
     Selecting this item will cause the buffer to visit the file in a
     read-only mode. Changes to the file will not be allowed.

Case Sensitive Search
     Selecting this item will cause searches to be case-sensitive. If
     its not selected then searches will ignore case. This option is
     local to the buffer. For example, if this item is selected and you
     are searching for `Smile', then an occurrence of `smile' will not
     be recognized because of the smaller case of `s'.

Overstrike
     After selecting this item, when you type letters they will replace
     existing text on a one-to-one basis, rather than pushing it to the
     right. At the end of a line, such characters extend the line.
     Before a tab, such characters insert until the tab is filled in.

Auto Delete Selection
     Selecting this item will cause automatic deletion of the selected
     region. After you select a region and hit the <RET> key, the
     selected text will be deleted. The typed text will replace the
     selection if the selection is active (i.e. if its highlighted). If
     the option is not selected then the typed text is just inserted at
     the cursor.

Teach Extended Commands
     After you  select this item, any time you execute a command with
     `M-x' which has a shorter keybinding, you will be shown the
     alternate binding before the command executes. For example if you
     type `M-x find-file-other-window' which performs the same function
     as the Open in Other Window... in File menu you will see the
     following message:

          M-x find-file-other-window (bound to keys: C-x 4 f, C-x 4 C-f)

Syntax Highlighting
     You can customize your `init.el' file to include the font-lock mode
     so that when you select this item, the comments will be displayed
     in one face, strings in another, reserved words in another, and so
     on. *Note Customization: (xemacs)Customization, for more
     information on customizing `init.el' file.  After selecting this
     item, you will find your code a lot easier to read. When Fonts is
     selected, different parts of the program will appear in different
     Fonts. When Colors is selected, then the program will be displayed
     in different colors. Selecting None causes the program to appear in
     just one Font and Color. Selecting Less resets the Fonts and Colors
     to a fast, minimal set of decorations. Selecting More resets the
     Fonts and Colors to a larger set of decorations. For example, if
     Less is selected (which is the default setting) then you might have
     all comments in green color. It does not matter what the comments
     contain. Whereas, if More is selected then a function name in the
     comments themselves might appear in a different Color or Font. Even
     though the comments themselves might appear in green color, a
     function name "within" the comments might appear in red color.

Paren Highlighting
     After selecting Blink from this item, if you place the cursor on a
     parenthesis, the matching parenthesis will blink. If you select
     Highlight and place the cursor on a parenthesis, the whole
     expression of the parenthesis under the cursor will be highlighted.
     Selecting None will turn off the options (regarding Paren
     Highlighting) which you had selected earlier.

Font
     You can select any Font for your program by choosing from one of
     the available Fonts. The whole buffer will be converted to the
     Font you select.

Size
     You can select any size for the text in your buffer (ranging from
     2 to 24) by selecting the appropriate option.

Weight
     You can choose either Bold or Medium for the weight of the text of
     your buffer.

Buffers Menu Length...
     Prompts you for the number of buffers to display. Then it will
     display that number of most recently selected buffers.

Buffers Sub-Menus
     After selection of this item the Buffers menu will contain several
     commands, as submenus of each buffer line. If this item is
     unselected, then there are no submenus for each buffer line, the
     only command available will be selecting that buffer.

Save Options
     Selecting this item will save the current settings of your Options
     menu to your `init.el' file so that the next time you start XEmacs,
     you won't need to select the options again.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Buffers Menu,  Next: Help menu,  Prev: Options Menu,  Up: Pull-down Menus

The Buffers Menu
----------------

The Buffers menu provides a selection of up to ten buffers and the item
List All Buffers, which provides a Buffer List. If you select Buffers
Sub-menus from the Options menu, you will get some sub-menus for each
of the buffer listing.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Help menu,  Prev: Buffers Menu,  Up: Pull-down Menus

The Help Menu
-------------

The Help Menu gives you access to Emacs Info and provides a menu
equivalent for some of the choices you have when using `C-h'.  *Note
Help::, for more information.

   The Describe variable and Describe function will provide
documentation for the corresponding variable or function. The Help menu
also gives access to UNIX online manual pages via the UNIX Manual...
option.

Basic Editing Commands
**********************

This chapter will introduce you to some basic editing commands. You can
also learn the basic editing commands by typing `Control-h t'
(`help-with-tutorial' OR by selecting Emacs Tutorial from the Help menu
on the menu bar. Most of the Emacs commands will use the <CONTROL> key
or the <META> key. The following abbreviations will be used for the
<CONTROL> and <META> key in this manual:

`C-<chr>'
     This means that you should hold down the <CONTROL> key while typing
     `<chr>'. For example, if the command is `C-g', you should hold the
     <CONTROL> key and type <g>.

`M-<chr>'
     This means that you should hold down the `META' key while typing
     `<chr>'. If there is no `META' key on your keyboard, use the `ESC'
     key instead. For example, if the command is `M-x', then type
     `ESC', release it and type `x'.

   The following abbreviations will be used for some other keys:

<SPC>
     Space bar.

<RET>
     Return key.

<LFD>
     Linefeed key.

<TAB>
     Tab.

<ESC>
     Escape.

<SFT>
     Shift.

* Menu:

* Insert::                      Insert text in Emacs by simply typing at
                                the cursor position.
* Cursor Position::             Moving Around the cursor in the buffer,
* Erase::                       Different commands for erasing text
* Numeric Argument::            Giving Numeric Arguments to commands
* Undo::                        Undoing Changes made by mistake


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Insert,  Next: Cursor Position,  Prev: Edit,  Up: Edit

Inserting Text
==============

To insert printing characters into the text you are editing, just type
them. Emacs will automatically insert the characters that you type into
the buffer at the cursor. The cursor moves forward, but if you prefer
to have text characters replace (overwrite) existing text characters,
you can enable the Overstrike option from the Options menu in the menu
bar.

   To "delete" text you have just inserted, use <DEL>.  <DEL> deletes
the character BEFORE the cursor (not the one that the cursor is on top
of or under; that is the character AFTER the cursor).  The cursor and
all characters after it move backwards.  Therefore, if you type a
printing character and then type <DEL>, they cancel out.

   To end a line and start typing a new one, type <RET>.  This inserts
a newline character in the buffer.  If point is in the middle of a
line, <RET> splits the line.  Typing <DEL> when the cursor is at the
beginning of a line rubs out the newline before the line, thus joining
the line with the preceding line.

   Emacs automatically splits lines when they become too long, if you
turn on a special mode called "Auto Fill" mode.  *Note Filling:
(xemacs)Filling, for information on using Auto Fill mode.

Moving Around
=============

The following commands will allow you to move the cursor around the
screen. The actual function names corresponding to these commands are
given in parenthesis. You can also invoke these commands by typing `M-x
<function name>'. You can do this for any command in XEmacs.

`C-b'
     Move the cursor backward one character (`backward-char').

`C-f'
     Move the cursor forward one character (`forward-char').

`C-p'
     Move the cursor up one line vertically (`previous-line').

`C-n'
     Move the cursor down one line vertically (`next-line').

`C-a'
     Move the cursor to the beginning of the line (`beginning-of-line').

`C-e'
     Move the cursor to the end of the line (`end-of-line').

`M-f'
     Move the cursor forward one word (`forward-word').

`M-b'
     Move the cursor backward one word (`backward-word').

`M-<'
     Move the cursor to the top of the buffer (`beginning-of-buffer').

`M->'
     Move the cursor to the end of the buffer (`end-of-buffer').

`M-x goto-char RET <number> RET'
     To enable this command type `M-x goto-char', and hit <RETURN> key.
     In the "echo area" you will see:

          Goto char:

     You should then type in a number right after the colon and hit the
     `RETURN' key again. After reading a number N this command will
     move the cursor to character number N.  Position 1 is the
     beginning of the buffer. For example, if you type `M-x goto-char
     RET 200 RET', then the cursor will move to the 200th character
     starting from the beginning of the buffer.

`M-x goto-line RET <number> RET'
     To enable this command type `M-x goto-line', and hit the <RETURN>
     key. After you see `Goto line:' in the "echo area", type in a
     number N and hit <RETURN> key again. This command will position
     the cursor on the nth line starting from the beginning of the
     buffer.

`M-x what-line RET'
     This command will display the current line number in the echo area.

Erasing Text
============

`<DEL>'
     If you press <DEL> i.e. the "delete" key, it will delete the
     character before the cursor (`delete-backward-char').

`C-d'
     This will delete the character after the cursor (`delete-char').

`C-k'
     Kill to the end of the line (`kill-line'). If you kill the line by
     mistake you can "yank" or `paste' it back by typing `C-y'. *Note
     Moving Text::, for more information on yanking.

`M-d'
     Kill forward to the end of the next word (`kill-word').

`M-<DEL>'
     Kill back to the beginning of the previous word
     (`backward-kill-word').

`M-k'
     Kill to the end of current sentence (`kill-sentence').

`M-z CHAR'
     Kill up to next occurrence of CHAR (`zap-to-char'). To use this
     command type `M-z'. You will see the following statement in the
     echo area :

          Zap to char:

     Type any char and press the <RET> key. For example, if you type
     `p' then the entire text starting from the position of the cursor
     until the first occurrence of `p' is killed.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Numeric Argument,  Next: Undo,  Prev: Erase,  Up: Edit

Giving Numeric Arguments
========================

Any Emacs command can be given a "numeric argument".  Some commands
interpret the argument as a repetition count.  For example, if you want
to move forward ten characters, you could type `C-f' ten times.
However, a more efficient way to do this would be to give an argument
of ten to the key `C-f' (the command `forward-char', move forward one
character). Negative arguments are also allowed. Often they tell a
command to move or act backwards. For example, if you want to move down
ten lines, type the following:
     C-u 10 C-n RET

After you press <RET> key, the cursor will move ten lines downward. You
can also type:
     M-10 C-n RET

Both `C-u' and `M-' allow you to give numeric arguments. If you want to
move ten lines backward, you can also give negative arguments, like:
     C-u -10 C-n RET

OR you could also type:
     M--10 C-n RET

You can obviously use `C-b' to move backward rather than giving
negative arguments to `C-n'. *Note Numeric Arguments: (xemacs)Numeric
Arguments, for more information on numeric arguments.

Undoing Changes
===============

When you are editing a buffer, you might type something by mistake.
Emacs allows you to undo all changes you make to a buffer (but not more
than 8000 characters). Each buffer in Emacs keeps a record of the
changes made to it individually, so the undo command applies to the
current buffer. There are two undo commands:

`C-x u'
     Undo one batch of changes (usually, one command's worth).
     (`undo').

`C-_'
     The same as above, but this command might not be obvious to type
     on some keyboards so it might be better to use the above command.

   *Note Undoing Changes: (xemacs)Undoing Changes, for more information
on undoing changes.

Customize key bindings and menus
********************************

When you start Emacs, it reads the file `~/.xemacs/init.el' in the
`.xemacs/' subdirectory of your home directory. You can use this file
to initialize and customize Emacs to your liking. This file should
contain lisp-code. You can customize your `init.el' file to create new
menus, disable menus, change key bindings, enable a minor mode, etc.
Any kind of customization affects only a particular Emacs job that you
do them in. If you want to save your customizations `permanently' i.e.
for future use also, you have to put it in your `init.el' file. After
you make changes to your `init.el' file and save it, the changes will
be effective only after you start Emacs again i.e. for a new Emacs
process. To try out some of the examples in this section, highlight
that region and evaluate the region by giving the command `M-x
eval-region'. You will be able to see the results of your
customizations in that Emacs session only (*note Lisp Eval:
(xemacs)Lisp Eval.).

File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Customizing key Bindings,  Next: Customizing Menus,  Prev: Customization Basics,  Up: Customization Basics

Customize key bindings
======================

Most of Emacs commands use key sequences. *Note Keystrokes:
(xemacs)Keystrokes, for more information about Keys and Commands. In
Emacs, the keys themselves carry no meaning unless they are bound to a
function. For example, `C-n' moves the cursor to the next line because
its bound to the function next-line. Similarly, `C-p' moves to the
previous line because its bound to the function previous-line. The
functions themselves define a particular behavior. You can customize
the key `C-n' to move to the previous line by binding it to
previous-line and `C-p' to move to the next line by binding it to
next-line. To bind keys to globally run commands you need to use the
following syntax in your init.el file:

     `(global-set-key KEYS CMD)'

Here, `global-set-key' is a function which will bind the "keys" to the
specified "cmd". For example, if you type the following in your init.el
file:

     (global-set-key "\C-p" 'next-line)
     (global-set-key "\C-n" 'previous-line)

then `C-p' will move to the next line and `C-n' to the previous line.

   You can also disable a key binding, by using `nil' as the CMD in the
syntax stated above. Here, `nil' stands for `false' which means disable
a command or turn off a feature. If you want to enable a command or
turn on a particular feature use `t' which stands for `true'.  For
example, if you do not wish `C-x C-c' to `Exit Emacs' you can type the
following expression in your `init.el' file:

     (global-set-key "\C-x\C-c" nil)

You might want to have this statement in your `init.el' file because
its easy to hit this command by mistake and it could be annoying to exit
Emacs unintentionally. There is an Exit Emacs option in the File menu
which you might want to use instead. To make a particular key undefined
you can also use:

     (global-unset-key "\C-x\C-c")

Now if you use the command `C-x C-c', you will get an error saying that
the command is undefined.

   Some other customizations you could try are:
   *      (global-set-key 'button3 'beginning-of-buffer)

     Now when you press the third button of your mouse, the cursor will
     be placed at the `beginning-of-buffer'.

   *      (global-set-key 'f1 'goto-line)

     If you press the <F1> key, you will be prompted for a line number.
     After you type the line number and hit <RET>, the cursor will be
     placed on that line number.

   *      (global-set-key 'f2 'undo)

     Pressing <F2> will undo the last command. If you have a <undo> key
     on your keyboard, try binding that key to the undo command.

   Another syntax for customizing key bindings is: `(define-key KEYMAP
KEYS DEF)' It defines KEYS to run DEF in the keymap KEYMAP.

   KEYMAP is a keymap object which records the bindings of keys to the
commands that they run.

   KEYS is the sequence of keystrokes to bind.

   DEF is anything that can be a key's definition:

   Look at the following two examples:

     (define-key global-map "\C-xl" 'make-symbolic-link)
     (define-key c-mode-map "\C-xl" 'make-symbolic-link)

Both the examples bind the key `C-xl' to run the function
`make-symbolic-link' (*note Misc File Ops: (xemacs)Misc File Ops.).
However, the second example will bind the key only for C mode. *Note
Major Modes: (xemacs)Major Modes, for more information on Major Modes
in XEmacs.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Customizing Menus,  Prev: Customizing key Bindings,  Up: Customization Basics

Customizing Menus
=================

You can customize any of the  XEmacs Pull-down-Menus. You can create
your own menu, delete an existing one, enable a menu or disable a menu.
For more information on the default menus available to you, *Note
Pull-down Menus::.

   Some of the functions which are available to you for customization
are:
  1. add-menu-item: (MENU-NAME ITEM-NAME FUNCTION ENABLED-P &optional
     BEFORE)

     This function will add a menu item to a menu, creating the menu
     first if necessary. If the named item already exists, the menu
     will remain unchanged. For example, if you add the following
     example to your `init.el' file or evaluate it (*note Customization
     Basics::),

          (add-menu-item '("Edit") "Replace String" replace-string t "Clear")

     a sub-menu Replace String will be created under Edit menu before
     the sub-menu Clear. The Edit menu will now look like:

          Undo                    C-x u
          Cut                     cut
          Copy                    copy
          Paste                   paste
          Replace String
          Clear
          Start Macro Recording   C-x(
          End Macro Recording     C-x)
          Execute Last Macro      C-xe

     Replace String will now execute the function `replace-string'.
     Select this menu item. Emacs will prompt you for a string name to
     be replaced. Type a string and hit <RET>. Now type a new string to
     replace the old string and hit <RET>. All occurrences of the old
     string will be replaced by the new string. In this example,

     `Edit' is the MENU-NAME which identifies the menu into which the
     new menu item should be inserted.

     `Replace String' is the ITEM-NAME which names the menu item to be
     added.

     `replace-string' is the FUNCTION i.e. the command to be invoked
     when the menu item "Replace String" is selected.

     `t' is the ENABLED-P parameter which controls whether the menu
     item is selectable or not. This parameter can be either `t'
     (selectable), `nil' (not selectable), or a form to evaluate. This
     form is evaluated just before the menu is displayed, and the menu
     item will be selectable if the form returns non-`nil'.

     `Clear' is the &OPTIONAL BEFORE parameter which is the name of the
     menu before which the new menu or sub-menu should be added. The
     &OPTIONAL string means that this parameter is optional. You do not
     need to specify this parameter. If you do not specify this
     parameter in the example above, the Replace String menu item will
     be added at the end of the list of sub-menus in the Edit menu i.e.
     after Execute Last Macro.

     If you wish to add a new menu to the menubar, try:

          (add-menu-item nil "Bot" 'end-of-buffer t)

     This will create a new menu Bot on the menu bar. Selecting this
     menu will take you to the end of the buffer. Using `nil' for the
     parameter MENU-NAME will create a new menu. Your menu-bar will now
     look like:

          File Edit Options Buffers Bot                         Help

     The following example will illustrate how you can add sub-menus to
     the submenus themselves:

          (add-menu-item '("File" "Management") "Copy File" 'copy-file t)
          (add-menu-item '("File" "Management") "Delete File" 'delete-file t)
          (add-menu-item '("File" "Management") "Rename File" 'rename-file t)

     This will create a sub-menu Management under the File menu. When
     you select the submenu Management, it will contain three submenus:
     Copy File, Delete File and Rename File.

  2. delete-menu-item: (MENU-PATH) This function will remove the menu
     item defined by MENU-NAME from the menu hierarchy. Look at the
     following examples and the comments just above them which specify
     what the examples do.

          ;; deletes the "Replace String" menu item created earlier
          (delete-menu-item '("Edit" "Replace String"))
          
          ;; deletes the "Bot" menu created earlier
          (delete-menu-item '("Bot"))
          
          ;; deletes the sub-menu "Copy File" created earlier
          (delete-menu-item '("File" "File Management" "Copy File"))
          
          ;; deletes the sub-menu "Delete File" created earlier
          (delete-menu-item '("File" "Management" "Delete File"))
          
          ;; deletes the sub-menu "Rename File" created earlier
          (delete-menu-item '("File" "Management" "Rename File"))

  3. disable-menu-item: (MENU-NAME) Disables the specified menu item.
     The following example

          (disable-menu-item '("File" "Management" "Copy File"))

     will make the Copy File item unselectable. This menu-item would
     still be there but it will appear faded which would mean that it
     cannot be selected.

  4. enable-menu-item: (MENU-NAME) Enables the specified previously
     disabled menu item.

          (enable-menu-item '("File" "Management" "Copy File"))

     This will enable the sub-menu Copy File, which was disabled by the
     earlier command.

  5. relabel-menu-item: (MENU-NAME NEW-NAME) Change the string of the
     menu item specified by MENU-NAME to NEW-NAME.

Help
****

XEmacs provides a comprehensive Help facility. On the extreme right of
the menu-bar there is a Help menu. There are several help commands
provided by this menu. You can also use `C-h' for invoking the Help
facility. Type "?" for a list of keys you can type after typing `C-h'.
If you want more information on what your options are and what kind of
help you can get type "?" again. You will get a listing of all the keys
you can type and what they will do. Initially if you want help, type
`C-h' three times.

Help menu
=========

When you click on the Help menu with any of the mouse buttons you will
get the following menu items:

Info
     Selecting this item will take you to the Info page which is the
     online documentation browsing system. You can simply click on the
     highlighted items and "Info" will take you to the document
     providing information about that topic.

Describe Mode
     After you select this item, you will get a documentation on the
     major and minor modes which are enabled in the buffer you are
     working with. *Note Modes::, for information on Modes.

Hyper Apropos...
     After you select this item, you will see the following message in
     the echo area:

          List symbols matching regexp:

     If you type "mode" and hit <RET>, you will get a list of all the
     symbols (like functions and commands). You can now get
     documentation on any of the given symbols by "clicking" on any of
     the symbols (i.e. drag your mouse on the appropriate symbol and
     release the button). For example, if you "click" on the
     'auto-fill-mode' you will get the following message in the window
     at the bottom:

          auto-fill-mode
          
          Function, Command:
          
            Toggle auto-fill mode.
            With arg, turn auto-fill mode on if and only if arg is positive.
            In auto-fill mode, inserting a space at a column beyond `fill-column'
            automatically breaks the line at a previous space.
          
          Variable:
          
            value = nil
          
            variable not documented

Command Apropos...
     Selecting this item will prompt you for a string just like when you
     select Hyper Apropos.... After you give a string name, you will get
     a listing of all the functions and commands containing that string
     name with a very short description about what that command does.

Full Apropos...
     After you select this item, you will be prompted for a string name
     in the echo area:

          Apropos (regexp):

     Now you can give any string name, for example "mode" and hit
     <RET>. You will get a listing of all the variables and commands
     containing that string i.e "mode" with a short description of its
     function.

List Keybindings
     Select this item and you will get a listing of all the keys and the
     commands that they execute. Depending on which Major mode your
     buffer is in, you will get a listing of the special keybindings
     for that particular buffer also. For example, if you are in
     "Texinfo" mode, part of your list will contain:

          C-c C-c n       texinfo-insert-@node
          C-c C-c o       texinfo-insert-@noindent
          C-c C-c s       texinfo-insert-@samp
          C-c C-c t       texinfo-insert-@table
          C-c C-c v       texinfo-insert-@var
          C-c C-c x       texinfo-insert-@example
          C-c C-c {      texinfo-insert-braces

     These keybindings apply only to "Texinfo" mode. *Note Modes::, for
     more information on various modes.

Describe Key...
     After you select this item, you will be see the following message
     in the echo area:

          Describe Key:
     After you type a command key sequence, full documentation of that
     command will be displayed. For example if you type `C-g', you will
     see the following documentation for `C-g':

          keyboard-quit:
          Signal a `quit' condition.
     This means that `C-g' will quit whatever command you gave earlier.

Describe Function...
     This menu item provides documentation for a function. After you
     select this item, it will prompt you for a function name in the
     echo area:

          Describe function (default <some function name>):

     If you hit <RET> without giving a function name, you will get
     documentation for that default function name, otherwise if you
     type a function name and hit <RET>, you will get documentation for
     the given function.

Describe Variable...
     You can get documentation on any variable by selecting this menu
     item. It is similar to Describe Function and will prompt you for a
     variable name.

Unix Manual...
     After you select this item you will be prompted for a Unix command
     for which you wish to see the man page. You will see the following
     message in the echo area:

          Manual entry: (default <some name>)

     Now you can type any command, for example type `who' and press
     <RET>. You will get the man page for the Unix command `who' which
     lists who is on the system.

Major and Minor Modes
*********************

XEmacs is "language sensitive". It has several "major" and "minor"
modes.  The major modes customize Emacs to edit text of a particular
sort. There are major modes for C, Lisp, Emacs Lisp, LaTeX, English
etc. Within each major mode, certain functions and keys are redefined
to "suit" that particular sort of text. The minor modes provide certain
features which can be turned off or on at any time. Emacs can only be
in one major mode at any time, but it can turn on several minor modes
at the same time. After you have selected any major or minor mode, you
can select Describe Mode from the Help menu and you will get
documentation about those modes.

* Menu:

* Major Modes::                 Choosing Major Modes
* Minor Modes::                 Auto-Fill, Abbrev and other minor modes

Major Modes
===========

Emacs has several major modes which customize Emacs to edit text of
various sorts. You can have only one major mode at any time. Within each
major mode, Emacs redefines certain functions (like cursor movement,
indentation and text killing) to suit the needs of the text being
edited. When you are editing a specific type of text you should switch
to the appropriate mode. If you are working with C code, you should
switch to C mode; if you are working with Lisp code, then switch to lisp
mode and if you are working with English text switch to Text mode.

   When you open a file to work on, Emacs usually selects the
appropriate mode. For example, if you open a file called `guide.c' then
Emacs will select the C mode because of the ".c" extension of the file.
To explicitly select a mode type the following command:

     ;;; selects lisp mode
     M-x lisp-mode
     
     ;;; selects C mode
     M-x c-mode

To select any other mode, just add the major mode name before the
'-mode'. The current mode in which you are in will be displayed in
parenthesis in the mode-line at the bottom of the frame. All major
modes have some special keybindings and you can get a listing of those
keybindings by selecting List Keybindings from the Help menu on the
menu bar.

   Some of the available modes in XEmacs are :

fundamental-mode
     When you start XEmacs, usually you start with the default
     "Fundamental" mode. This mode has no special definitions or
     settings.

nroff-mode
     Use this mode when you have to format a text with nroff before it
     can be available in readable form. It redefines some indentation
     commands. *Note Nroff Mode: (xemacs)Nroff Mode, for information on
     this mode.

tex-mode
     Use this mode if you are using the LaTeX text-formatter. It
     provides commands for insertion of quotes, braces and other
     characters. It also allows you to format the buffer for printing.
     *Note TeX Mode: (xemacs)TeX Mode, for information on this mode.

texinfo-mode
     Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
     produce both printed output and on-line documentation. When you
     use this mode, there will be some special keybindings for
     inserting some characters and executing some commands.

     This info file which you are reading right now is produced by
     'Texinfo'

outline-mode
     Use this mode for editing outlines. When you enable this mode, you
     can make part of the text temporarily invisible so that you can
     see the overall structure of the outline. *Note Outline Mode:
     (xemacs)Outline Mode, for information on this mode.

c-mode
     Use this mode for C programs. It will redefine some indentation
     commands. *Note C Indent: (xemacs)C Indent.

lisp-mode
     Use this mode for Lisp programs. Look at the XEmacs User's Manual
     for more information.

fortran-mode
     Use this mode for Fortran programs. This mode provides special
     commands to move around and some other indentation commands.  For
     more information on this mode, *Note Fortran: (xemacs)Fortran.

edit-picture
     This is the picture mode which you can use to create a picture out
     of text characters. *Note Picture: (xemacs)Picture, for more
     information.

asm-mode
     Use asm-mode for editing files of assembler code. Look at the file
     ` /usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/lisp/modes/asm.el' for more
     information.


   There are some other modes and commands for working with other kinds
of text or programs. Emacs also provides commands for reading and
sending Mail. For more information on these features look at the XEmacs
Manual. Emacs also provides the functions of a desk calendar, with a
diary of past or planned events. For more information on the calendar
mode look at the manual for Calendar Mode and Diary.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Minor Modes,  Prev: Major Modes,  Up: Modes

Minor Modes
===========

The minor modes in Emacs provide some optional features which you can
turn on or off. Any number of minor modes can be active at the same time
with any major mode. You can enable a minor mode in one buffer and
disable it in other mode. To enable a minor mode, for example the
font-lock mode type the following command:

     M-x font-lock-mode

To enable the other minor modes, replace the "font-lock" with the name
of the minor mode. To disable the mode type the command again. A
positive argument will always turn the mode on. Whenever you type this
command, it will turn the mode on if it was off, OR it will turn it off
if it was on i.e. it toggles. Look at the mode-line at the bottom of the
frame. If it says FLock in parentheses, then it means that this mode is
on, otherwise it is off.

   The following are some of the minor modes available in XEmacs. To
enable any one of them type "M-x" in front of them.

font-lock-mode
     You can also choose this mode by selecting the Syntax Highlighting
     menu item from the Options menu on the menu-bar at the top. If you
     wish to have this mode enabled permanently, choose Save Options
     from the Options menu. *Note Options Menu::, for more information
     on the Options menu.  You can also add statements in your
     `init.el' file. For each major mode in which you wish to enable
     this minor mode, you need a statement in your `init.el' file. The
     following example shows how to enable the font-lock mode when the
     major mode is c-mode.

          (add-hook 'c-mode-hook          'turn-on-font-lock)

     *Note Other Customizations::.

     When you enable this mode, the text will be displayed in different
     colors and fonts depending on the type of the text. This makes the
     text very easy to read and understand. For example, comments might
     be displayed in red, variables in black, functions in blue and
     other keywords in different colors and fonts. When you select More
     from the Syntax Highlighting option, you get very detailed display
     of colors and fonts; function names within comments themselves
     might appear in a different font and color.

auto-fill-mode
     Enabling this mode will provide automatic word-wrapping. The <SPC>
     key will break lines i.e. insert newlines as you type to prevent
     lines from becoming too long.

overwrite-mode
     When you enable this mode, the text that you type will replace the
     existing text rather than moving it to the right (the default
     case). You can enable this mode by selecting Overstrike menu-item
     from the Options menu from the menu-bar.

abbrev-mode
     After you enable this mode, you can define words which will expand
     into some different text i.e. you can define abbreviations. For
     example, you might define "expand" to "expand will eventually
     expand to this text". After this definition you will be able to
     get "expand will eventually expand to this text" simply by typing

          expand <SPC>

     *Note Abbrevs: (xemacs)Abbrevs, for more information on this mode
     and on defining abbreviations.

auto-save-mode
     After you enable this mode in a buffer, the contents of that
     buffer will be saved periodically. This will reduce the amount you
     might lose in case of a system crash.

line-number-mode
     After you enable this mode, the line number at which your cursor is
     present will be displayed continuously in the mode line.

blink-paren
     To enable this command, just type
          M-x blink-paren

     Do not add the "-mode" to it.  You can also select the Paren
     Highlighting option from the Options menu. After you enable this
     command, put your cursor on one of the left parenthesis. The other
     matching parenthesis will start blinking. *Note Options Menu::,
     for more information on the Paren Highlighting option.

   For information on some other modes, look at the XEmacs User's Manual
and the associated files.

Files
*****

The basic unit of stored data in Unix is the "file".  To edit a file,
you must tell Emacs to read the file into a buffer. This is called
"visiting" the file. You can now edit the buffer and to save the
changes you must write the buffer back to the file.

   In addition to visiting and saving files, Emacs can delete, copy,
rename, and append to files, and operate on file directories.

* File Names::                  How to type and edit file name arguments.
* Visiting::                    Visiting a file prepares Emacs to edit the file.
* Saving Files::                How to save Emacs files.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: File Names,  Next: Visiting,  Prev: Files,  Up: Files

File Names
==========

Most of the Emacs commands that operate on a file require you to
specify a file name. For example, you might specify the file name
initially when you enter Emacs :

     xemacs myfile RET

After you hit <RET>, you will enter XEmacs with "myfile" read into the
current buffer. If you do not specify the filename when entering Emacs,
you can use the Open... option from the File menu. You will be prompted
for a filename in the echo area:

     Find file: /usr/workspace/

Type in a file name which you want to open after the "/" and hit <RET>.
The specified file will be read into the current buffer. The
"/usr/workspace" might be the "default directory". When Emacs prompts
you for a file, it uses the default-directory unless you specify a
directory. You can see what the default directory of the current buffer
is by using the Describe Variable option from the Help menu. When Emacs
prompts you for the variable name to describe, type
`default-directory'. If you wish to open a file in some other
directory, use <DEL> or the <BackSpace> key to go back and type the
path name of the new directory.

   You can create a new directory by typing `M-x make-directory'. This
command will prompt you for a directory name:

     Create directory: /usr/workspace/

After you type a directory name and press <RET>, a new directory with
the specified name will be created. If you do not wish to create a new
directory, then simply press `C-g' to quit the command. Similarly, you
can also remove a directory by using the command `remove-directory'.
The command `M-x pwd' will print the current buffer's default
directory. For more information on file names, *Note File Names:
(xemacs)File Names.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Visiting,  Next: Saving Files,  Prev: File Names,  Up: Files

Visiting Files
==============

To edit a file in Emacs you need to "visit" it. "Visiting" a file means
copying its contents (or reading them) into the current buffer. Emacs
will create a new buffer for each file that you visit. The buffer will
be named after the file that you open. If you open a file
`/usr/workspace/myfile.texinfo', the buffer will be called
"myfile.texinfo". If a buffer with this name already exists, a unique
name will be constructed by appending `<2>', `<3>', etc. If this is the
second buffer with the same name, a "<2>" will be appended, "<3>" for a
third buffer and so on. The name of the buffer which is being displayed
in the window will be shown both at the top and bottom of the frame.
Once you are in XEmacs, you can use the following commands:

`C-x C-f'
     This command will visit a file (`find-file'). It will prompt you
     for a file name to visit. The Open... option from the File menu
     does the same thing:

          Find file: /usr/workspace/

     Type in a filename and press <RET>. You will see a new buffer on
     the screen with its name in the mode-line. If the filename you
     specify already exists in Emacs, the buffer containing that file
     will be selected. You will get an error message if the filename
     does not exist. If you still press <RET>, a new buffer with the
     given filename will be displayed on the screen.

`C-x C-v'
     This command (`find-alternate-file'), will visit a different file
     instead of the one visited last. It is similar to `C-c C-f' except
     that it kills the current buffer (after offering to save it).

`C-x 5 C-f'
     This command will visit a file in another frame
     (`find-file-other-frame') without changing the current window or
     frame. The Open in New Frame... from the File menu will do the
     same thing. It will prompt you for a file name in the echo area.
     After you type the file name and press <RET>, the specified file
     will be read into a new buffer and displayed on a new frame.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Saving Files,  Prev: Visiting,  Up: Files

Saving Files
============

The changes that you make after visiting a file will not be saved
unless you save the buffer. When you save the buffer, Emacs writes the
current contents of the buffer into the visited file. Some commands to
save buffers are:

`C-x C-s'
     This command will permanently save the current buffer in its
     visited file (`save-buffer'). You will see the following message
     in the echo area if you save a file called "myfile.texinfo" :

          Wrote /usr/workspace/myfile.texinfo

     Try using this command twice. You will get the above message the
     first time you use this command, the second time you will get the
     following message:

          (No changes need to be saved)

     This message indicates that you haven't made any changes since the
     last time you saved the file.

`C-x s'
     This command will save all the buffers in their visited files
     (`save-some-buffers'). It will prompt you for typing yes or no:

          Save file /usr/workspace/myfile.texinfo? (y or n)

     You will get the above message for all the buffers. Type "y" if
     you want to save the buffer.

`C-x C-w'
     This command will prompt you for a file name and save the current
     buffer in that file. (`write-file'). You will see the following
     message in the echo area:

          Write file: /usr/workspace/

     After you type in a file name, press <RET>. The buffer will be
     saved in a new file. You can make copies of a particular file
     using this command.

   You can also undo all the changes made since the file was visited or
saved by reading the text from the file again (called "reverting"). For
more information on this option, *Note Reverting: (xemacs)Reverting.

   When you save a file in Emacs, it destroys its old contents. However,
if you set the variable `make-backup-files' to non-`nil' i.e. `t',
Emacs will create a "backup" file. Select the Describe variable option
from the Help menu and look at the documentation for this variable. Its
default value should be `t'. However, if its not then use `M-x
set-variable' to set it to `t' (*note Setting Variables::). The backup
file will contain the contents from the last time you visited the file.
Emacs also provides options for creating numbered backups. For more
information on backups, *Note Backup: (xemacs)Backup.

   Emacs also saves all the files from time to time so that in case of a
system crash you don't lose lot of your work. You will see the message
`Auto-saving...' displayed in the echo area when the buffer is being
saved automatically. The auto saved files are named by putting the
character `#' in front and back. For example a file called
"myfile.texinfo" would be named as `#myfile.texinfo#'. For information
on controlling auto-saving and recovering data from auto-saving, *Note
Auto Save Files: (xemacs)Auto Save Files.

   Emacs provides protection from simultaneous editing which occurs if
two users are visiting the same file and trying to save their changes.
It will put a lock on a file which is being visited and modified. If
any other user tries to modify that file, it will inform the user about
the lock and provide some options. For more information on protection
against simultaneous editing, *Note Interlocking: (xemacs)Interlocking.

Other Customizations
********************

You can modify the behavior of Emacs in minor ways permanently by
putting your changes in your `init.el' file. This file contains Lisp
function call expressions. Each of these expressions will consist of a
function name followed by arguments, all surrounded by parentheses. For
example, to turn on the auto-fill-mode (i.e. break lines automatically
when they become too long) , put the following  line in your `init.el'
file:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook
             '(lambda() (auto-fill-mode 1)))

Emacs has a function named "turn-on-auto-fill" which is defined as
"(lambda() (auto-fill-mode 1))". Therefore you can also write the above
as:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

Emacs provides a number of hooks for the sake of customization. The hook
variables contain list of functions to be called with no arguments. To
turn on the auto-fill-mode, add the appropriate hook as shown in the
example above.

   Similarly, to enable the "font-lock mode" which displays your
program in different fonts and colors(*note Modes::), put the following
in your `init.el' file. The comments above the statement explain what
the statements do.

     ;;; enables the font-lock-mode in Lisp Mode
     (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook    'turn-on-font-lock)
     
     ;;; enables the font-lock-mode in Texinfo Mode
     (add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook    'turn-on-font-lock)
     
     ;;; enables the font-lock mode in C Mode
     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook          'turn-on-font-lock)

   To turn on the font-lock mode in other Major Modes like emacs-lisp,
just put the name of the mode with "-hook" appended to it as the middle
parameter in the above examples. You can also select the color that the
functions, comments or other keywords  should be displayed in :

     ;;; the function names will now be displayed in blue color
     (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-function-name-face "blue")
     
     ;;; the comments will be displayed in forest green
      (set-face-foreground 'font-lock-comment-face "forest green")

For other customizations regarding the font-lock face, look at the file
`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/etc/sample.init.el'.

Other Customizations
====================

In XEmacs, "variables" are used for internal record-keeping and
customizations. There are some variables called "options" which you can
use for customizations. To examine a variable use:

     ;;; print the value and documentation of the variable, use either of the
     ;;; following commands
     C-h v
     M-x describe variable

   After you type any of the above commands, you will be prompted for a
variable name in the "echo area". Type in the name of the variable, for
example, type  `case-fold-search' <RET> Your window will split into two
and you will see the following message in that window:

     case-fold-search's value is t
     This value is specific to the current buffer.
     
     Documentation:
     *Non-nil if searches should ignore case.
     Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.

Since this variable's value is 't' searches will ignore case. If you
want case-sensitive-search (i.e. if you are searching for "Foo" and you
do not want "foo" to be included in the search, you need to set this
variable to "nil". In order to do that, use:

     M-x set-variable

Emacs will prompt you for the variable which you wish to set. Type in
"case-fold-search" and hit <RET>. You will see the following message:

     Set case-fold-search to value:

Type "nil" and hit <RET>.  Now if you again use `M-x describe variable'
, you will see that the new value of case-fold-search will be "nil" and
your searches will be case-sensitive. This will be effective only for
that Emacs session. If you want to change the value of a variable
permanently put the following statement in your `init.el' file :

     (setq case-fold-search nil)

This statement will make searches case-sensitive only in the current
buffer which is the `init.el' file. This will not be very useful. To
make searches case-sensitive globally in all buffers, use:

     (setq-default case-fold-search nil)

   If you want to change the value of any other variable, use :

     (setq <variable-name> <new value>)

"setq" will assign the "new value" to the "variable-name" .

   If you want a list of the "options" i.e. the variables available for
customization type:


     ;;; displays a buffer listing names, values and documentation of options
     M-x list-options
     
     ;;; displays options and allows you to edit those list of options
     M-x edit-options

Try these options. If you are using edit-options to edit a variable,
just point at the variable you wish to edit and use one of the following
commands:

1
     Set the value of the variable to t (non-nil).

0
     Set the value of the variable to nil.

n
     Move to the next variable.

p
     Move to the previous variable.

   There are some other options available to make the value of a
variable local to a buffer and then to switch to its global value. You
can also have a "local variables list" in a file which specifies the
values to use for certain Emacs variables when you edit that file.
*Note Variables: (xemacs)Variables, for information on these options.

Init File Examples
==================

For customizing Emacs, you need to put Lisp expressions in your
`init.el' file. The following are some useful Lisp expressions. If you
find any of them useful, just type them in your `init.el' file:

   * The following expression will make <TAB> in C mode insert a real
     tab character if the cursor or point is in the middle of the line.
     Now hitting the <TAB> key will indent a line only if the cursor is
     at the left margin or in the line's indentation:

          (setq c-tab-always-indent nil)

     The value of the variable `c-tab-always-indent' is usually `t' for
     `true'. When this variable is true, then hitting the <TAB> key
     always indents the current line.

   * This expression will turn on the AUTO-FILL-MODE when you are in
     text mode:

          (setq text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

     This mode will automatically break lines when you type a space so
     that the lines don't become too long. The length of the lines is
     controlled by the variable `fill-column'. You can set this
     variable to a value you wish. Look at the documentation for this
     variable to see its default value. To change the value to 75 for
     example, use:

          (setq-default fill-column 75)

     This will change the value of this variable globally.

   * The following expression will enable the use of EVAL-EXPRESSION
     without confirmation:

          (put 'eval-expression 'disabled nil)

     Now when you use EVAL-EXPRESSION, it will print the value of the
     expression you specify in the "echo area" without confirming with
     you.

   * This expression will remove the binding of `C-x C-c', because its
     easy to hit this key by mistake and you will exit Emacs
     unintentionally. You can use the Exit Emacs option from the File
     menu to exit Emacs.

          (global-set-key "\C-x\C-c" nil)

     Now if you type `C-x C-c', you won't exit Emacs.

   * The following expression will make the <BACKSPACE> and the <DEL>
     key work in the same manner:

          (global-set-key 'backspace [delete])

   * This expression will make searches case sensitive:

          (setq-default case-fold-search nil)

     If we use "setq" instead of "setq-default" then searches will be
     case-sensitive only in the current buffer's local value. In this
     case the buffer would be the `init.el' file. Since this would not
     be too helpful and we want to have case-sensitive searches in all
     buffers, we have to use "setq-default".

   * This expression will enable the font-lock mode when you are using
     texinfo mode:

          (add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

     *Note Minor Modes::, for information on font-lock mode.

   * Rebinds the key `C-x l' to run the function `make-symbolic-link':

          (global-set-key "\C-xl" 'make-symbolic-link)

     We use the single quote before "make-symbolic-link" because its a
     function name. You can also use the following expression which
     does the same thing:

          (define-key global-map "C-xl" 'make-symbolic-link)

   * The following expression will bind `C-x l' to run the function
     `make-symbolic-link' in C mode only:

          (define-key c-mode-map "C-xl" 'make-symbolic-link)

     Instead of binding `C-xl' to run `make-symbolic-link', you can
     bind the <F1> key to run this function:

          (define-key c-mode-map 'f1 'make-symbolic-link)

     Here, you have to use lower case for naming function keys like
     <F1>.

   * You can bind the function `undo' i.e. `C-x u' to any key, for
     example to <F2>:

          (global-set-key 'f2 'undo)

   * The following statement will display the current time in the
     modeline of the buffer:

          (display-time)

   * This displays the current line number on which the cursor is
     present in the modeline:

          (setq line-number-mode t)

   * If you don't want the text to be highlighted when you use commands
     for marking regions so as to use the "kill" and "yank" commands
     later, you can use the following expression in your `init.el' file:

          (setq zmacs-regions nil)

     Now if you use a command like `C-x C-p' (`mark-page'), the text
     will not be highlighted.

   * To control the number of buffers listed when you select the Buffers
     menu, you need to set the variable `buffers-menu-max-size' to
     whatever value you wish. For example, if you want 20 buffers to be
     listed when you select Buffers use:

          (setq buffers-menu-max-size 20)

   * If you want the window title area to display the full
     directory/name of the current buffer's file, and not just the
     name, use:

          (setq frame-title-format "%S: %f")

   * To get rid of the menu, use :

          (set-menubar nil)

   * If you want an extensive menu-bar use the following expression in
     your `init.el' file.

          (load "big-menubar")

     If you want to write your own menus, you can look at some of the
     examples in
     `/usr/local/lib/xemacs/xemacs-packages/lisp/edit-utils/big-menubar.el'
     file.


   For more information on initializing your `init.el' file, *Note Init
File: (xemacs)Init File. You should also look at
`/usr/local/lib/xemacs-VERSION/etc/sample.init.el', which is a sample
`init.el' file. It contains some of the commonly desired customizations
in Emacs.

Selecting and Moving Text
*************************

Many Emacs commands operate on an arbitrary contiguous part of the
current buffer. You can select some part of the buffer and edit only
that part of the buffer. This selected buffer is called a "region". You
can select text in two ways:

   * You use special keys to select text by defining a region between
     the cursor and "the mark" (which you set).

   * If you are running XEmacs under X, you can also select text with
     the mouse.

* Menu:

* Selecting Text::              Select a region of text by setting the Mark
* Mouse::                       Selecting Text with Mouse
* Region Operation::            Various ways to operate on a selected text
* Moving Text::                 Moving Text
* Accumulating text::           Accumulating Text from several buffers


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Selecting Text,  Next: Mouse,  Prev: Select and Move,  Up: Select and Move

Setting the Mark
================

To define a region you need to set "the mark" at one end of it and move
the cursor to the other end. Once you set the mark, it remains there
until you set it again to some other place. Each buffer has its own
"mark ring" (a place where Emacs remembers 16 previous locations of the
mark). To set "the mark", you can use the following commands:

`C-<SPC>'
     This command will set "the mark" at the position of your cursor
     (`set-mark-command').  You can move your cursor around and "the
     mark" will stay there.

`C-x C-x'
     Interchange mark and point (`exchange-point-and-mark'). Since Emacs
     will have only one cursor, after you move the cursor it will be
     unable to show you where you set the "the mark". In order to see
     "the mark" you can type the command `C-x C-x' which will put your
     cursor on the position of your mark and your mark on the position
     of your cursor. Use the command again to reset the positions of
     your cursor and mark.

`C-<'
     This command will push the mark at the beginning of the buffer
     without changing the position of your cursor.

`C->'
     This command will push the mark at the end of the buffer without
     changing the position of your cursor.

You can also give arguments to `C-<' or `C->'. *Note The Mark and the
Region: (xemacs)The Mark and the Region, for more information.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Mouse,  Next: Region Operation,  Prev: Selecting Text,  Up: Select and Move

Selecting Text with Mouse
=========================

If you are using XEmacs under X, you can use the mouse to select text.
The selected text will always be highlighted, so just by looking at the
text you know what you have selected so far. To select a word just
double-click with the left-mouse-button on the word. To select a whole
line triple-click anywhere on the line with the left-mouse-button. You
can also use the Copy item from the Edit menu on the menu-bar to select
text. This kind of selection is called Clipboard selection, *Note X
Clipboard Selection: (xemacs)X Clipboard Selection, for more
information. To select an arbitrary region, follow these steps:

  1. Move the mouse cursor over the character at the beginning of the
     region of text you want to select.

  2. Press and hold the left mouse button.

  3. While holding the left mouse button down, drag the cursor to the
     character at the end of the region of text you want to select.

  4. Release the left mouse button.
        The selected region of text is highlighted.

   *Note Selecting Text with the Mouse: (xemacs)Selecting Text with the
Mouse, for more information regarding the Mouse and additional mouse
operations.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Region Operation,  Next: Moving Text,  Prev: Mouse,  Up: Select and Move

Operating on the Region
=======================

Once you have selected a region you can do a lot of things to the text
in the region:
   * Kill the text with `C-w'. For example if you want to kill a
     paragraph, position the cursor to the beginning of the paragraph
     and type `C-SPC'. Then go to the end of the paragraph and type
     `C-w'. The entire paragraph will be deleted. You can also select
     the text with a mouse and type `C-w' to kill the entire region.
     *Note Killing: (xemacs)Killing, for more information.

   * Save the text in a buffer or a file (*note Accumulating Text:
     (xemacs)Accumulating Text.).

   * You can convert the case of the text with `C-x C-l' or `C-x C-u'
     If you type `C-x C-u' the selected text will become all
     upper-case. If you type `C-x C-l' the selected text will become all
     lower-case.

   * Print hardcopy with `M-x print-region'. *Note Hardcopy:
     (xemacs)Hardcopy, for more information. This command will print a
     hardcopy of only the selected text.

   * Indent it with `C-x <TAB>' or `C-M-\' *Note Indentation:
     (xemacs)Indentation, for more information.


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Moving Text,  Next: Accumulating text,  Prev: Region Operation,  Up: Select and Move

Moving Text
===========

The most common way to move or copy text in Emacs is through "killing"
or `cutting' it and then "yanking" or `pasting' it. You can also use
the Cut or Copy option from the Edit menu for killing and copying
respectively. *Note Edit menu::, for reviewing the commands for killing
text. All the killed text in Emacs is recorded in the "kill ring".
Since there is only one kill ring in Emacs, you can kill text in one
buffer and yank it in another buffer. To `paste' or `yank' the killed
text you can use the following commands:
`C-y'
     This command will yank or paste the last killed text (`yank').

`M-w'
     Save region as last killed text without actually killing it
     (`copy-region-as-kill'). You can use this command to copy a
     selected region and then yank (or paste) it without actually
     removing it from the buffer.

`C-M-w'
     Append next kill to last batch of killed text
     (`append-next-kill'). This command will append whatever you killed
     last to what you kill now. Then later you will be able to yank the
     entire appended text from the "kill ring".


File: new-users-guide.info,  Node: Accumulating text,  Prev: Moving Text,  Up: Select and Move

Accumulating Text
=================

The following commands can be used for accumulating text from different
buffers into one place or for copying one region of text into many
buffers:

`M-x append-to-buffer'
     Append region to contents of specified buffer
     (`append-to-buffer'). After you type in this command and press
     <RET>, Emacs will prompt you for a buffer name. You will see a
     message in the echo area:
          Append to buffer: (default <buffer name>)

     After you type in a buffer name, a copy of the region will be
     inserted at the location of the cursor into that buffer. If there
     is no buffer with the name given by you, Emacs will create a new
     buffer with that name. By default the cursor's position in the
     <buffer name> is at the end.

`M-x prepend-to-buffer'
     Prepend region to contents of specified buffer. This command is
     similar to the above command except that the cursor in the buffer
     (by default) is at the beginning rather than at the end.

`M-x copy-to-buffer'
     Copy region into specified buffer, deleting that buffer's old
     contents. This command will also prompt you for a buffer name.

`M-x insert-buffer'
     Insert contents of specified buffer into current buffer at point.
     This command will prompt you for a buffer name which you want to
     be copied into the current buffer at the location of the cursor.

`M-x append-to-file'
     This command will prompt you for a filename and append the region
     to the end of the contents of the specified file.

*Note Accumulating Text: (xemacs)Accumulating Text, for more
information regarding this topic.

   You can also use "rectangle commands" for operating on rectangular
areas of text. *Note Rectangles: (xemacs)Rectangles, for more
information regarding rectangle commands.

   Emacs also provides "registers" which serve as temporary storage for
text or positions. Each register has a one character name and they can
store "regions", a "rectangle", or a "mark" i.e. a cursor position.
Whatever you store in register stays there until you store something
else in that register. To find out about commands which manipulate
registers *Note Registers: (xemacs)Registers.

Searching and Replacing
***********************

Emacs provides commands for searching for occurrences of a particular
string. The search is incremental i.e. it begins even before you
complete typing the whole string. All searches in Emacs ignore the case
of the text they are searching, i.e. if you are searching for "String",
then "string" will also be one of the selections. If you want a case
sensitive search select the Case Sensitive Search from the Option menu.
You can also set the variable `case-fold-search' to `nil' for making
searches case-sensitive. For information on setting variables, *Note
Setting Variables::. The two commands for searching for strings in
XEmacs are:

`C-s'
     This command will prompt you for a string to search :

          I-search:

     If you type "myname" as the string to be searched, then Emacs will
     start searching for "m", "my", "myn", etc as you go on typing the
     whole string in the forward direction. The cursor will be on the
     matching string which has been found so far. If you find the
     correct match just hit <RET> or type `C-f' or `C-b' to set the
     cursor's position. If you find a matching string "myname" but you
     were looking for a different occurrence of it, use `C-s' again. If
     the search is unable to find the string, it will give you an error
     message.

`C-r'
     This command will perform an incremental search in the backward
     direction. It will prompt you for a string name:

          I-search backward:

     After you start typing the string name, it will search for the
     string in the same fashion as it does for `C-s' except that it
     will search in the backward direction. If it cannot find the
     string name, it will give you an error message.

   If you make a mistake while typing the string names when you use the
above commands, you can use the <DEL> key to erase characters. Each
<DEL> will erase the last character. At any time if you want to quit
the search, just type `C-g'.

   To do a non-incremental search i.e. to start the search only after
you have typed the whole string you can use the following commands:

`C-s RET "string" RET'
     This command will search for the specified string in the forward
     direction and will give an error message if the string is not
     found.

`C-r RET "string" RET'
     This command will search for the specified string in the backward
     direction.

   For information on how Emacs searches for words and regular
expressions, *Note Search: (xemacs)Search.

   To replace all occurrences of a string in Emacs, you can use the
following command:
     M-x replace-string

After you type `M-x replace-string', you will be prompted for a string
name to replace:

     Replace string:

After you type in a string name, for example "FOO" and press <RET>, you
will see another prompt:

     Replace string FOO with:

Now type the string which you want to replace "FOO" with and press
<RET>. After all the occurrences are replaced you will see the message
"Done" in the echo area.  If you want only some occurrences of the
string to be replaced, use `M-x query-replace RET <string> RET
<newstring> RET'. For more information, *Note Query Replace:
(xemacs)Query Replace.

   XEmacs also provides a utility for checking spellings. Use `M-x
ispell-buffer' to check for spellings in the whole buffer. You can also
check the spelling of a word or a region. You can use menus to check
for spellings:

Evaluate the expression `(load "big-menubar")'. To evaluate this
expression you need to hit the <META> or the <ESC> key twice and type
in the expression in the echo area before hitting <RET>. You will get
an extensive menubar. Select the Spell Check menu item from the
Utilities menu for checking spellings.
